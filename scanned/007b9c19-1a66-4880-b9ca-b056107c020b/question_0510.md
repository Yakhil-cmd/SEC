# Q510: crypto: server config signature/domain

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a protocol peer submits malformed DKG/IDKG dealings, complaints, openings, or signature shares and drive `rs/crypto/src/tls/rustls/server_handshake.rs`::server_config with attacker-controlled transcripts, dealings, complaints, openings, signature shares, derivation paths, and message bytes to reuse signatures, transcripts, or request IDs across domains, algorithms, or registry versions; specifically, can this trigger parser ambiguity so two encodings verify as the same key or message in different layers, violating the invariant that node/canister/TLS key validation must not accept keys outside the registered identity context, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/crypto/src/tls/rustls/server_handshake.rs`::server_config
- Entrypoint: a protocol peer submits malformed DKG/IDKG dealings, complaints, openings, or signature shares
- Attacker controls: transcripts, dealings, complaints, openings, signature shares, derivation paths, and message bytes
- Exploit idea: trigger parser ambiguity so two encodings verify as the same key or message in different layers
- Invariant to test: node/canister/TLS key validation must not accept keys outside the registered identity context
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass
- Fast validation: fuzz encodings/transcripts/signature shares and assert verification rejects cross-domain or malformed variants; mutate domain separators, registry versions, signer IDs, and message bytes independently
