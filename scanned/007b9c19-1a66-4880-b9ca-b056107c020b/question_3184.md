# Q3184: boundary: api boundary nodes count resource accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an unprivileged user sends malformed signatures, delegations, principals, or WebAuthn credentials to ingress validation and drive `rs/boundary_node/rate_limits/canister/state.rs`::api_boundary_nodes_count with attacker-controlled HTTP method/path/headers/body, canister ID, subnet ID, request ID, ingress expiry, signatures, and delegations to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this serve stale or forged certified data by confusing cache keys, hostnames, or read_state witness paths, violating the invariant that malformed public requests must fail closed without crashing in-scope platform components, and produce HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/boundary_node/rate_limits/canister/state.rs`::api_boundary_nodes_count
- Entrypoint: an unprivileged user sends malformed signatures, delegations, principals, or WebAuthn credentials to ingress validation
- Attacker controls: HTTP method/path/headers/body, canister ID, subnet ID, request ID, ingress expiry, signatures, and delegations
- Exploit idea: serve stale or forged certified data by confusing cache keys, hostnames, or read_state witness paths
- Invariant to test: malformed public requests must fail closed without crashing in-scope platform components
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash
- Fast validation: send crafted HTTP/API requests in a local boundary/replica setup and compare validation, routing, and certification outputs
