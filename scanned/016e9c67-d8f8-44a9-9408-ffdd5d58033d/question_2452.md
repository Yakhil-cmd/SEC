# Q2452: Add Route app tx invariant edge 4105

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `AddRoute` in `sei-cosmos/baseapp/queryrouter.go` via public Cosmos/EVM transaction processed by BaseApp and ante handlers, controlling transaction bytes, signatures, fee fields, message ordering, extension options, gas limits, and account sequence values, and trigger panic or unbounded work in default transaction processing using only public message fields so that the invariant `public transaction processing must not panic, undercharge fees, or commit partial state on failure paths` fails, causing `Low: Manipulation of transaction fee calculation resulting in fees outside protocol-defined bounds`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-cosmos/baseapp/queryrouter.go:25` `AddRoute`
- Entrypoint: public Cosmos/EVM transaction processed by BaseApp and ante handlers
- Attacker controls: transaction bytes, signatures, fee fields, message ordering, extension options, gas limits, and account sequence values
- Exploit idea: trigger panic or unbounded work in default transaction processing using only public message fields
- Invariant to test: public transaction processing must not panic, undercharge fees, or commit partial state on failure paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low: Manipulation of transaction fee calculation resulting in fees outside protocol-defined bounds
- Fast validation: Encode the transaction through the app TxConfig, execute CheckTx and FinalizeBlock/DeliverTx, and assert fees, gas, sequence, and state changes match the same interpretation.
