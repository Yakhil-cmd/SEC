# Q1406: chain fusion: count bytes rollback edge case

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a canister requests Bitcoin/Ethereum/Dogecoin integration data through public management or adapter paths and drive `rs/types/types/src/batch/chain_key.rs`::count_bytes with attacker-controlled deposit addresses, UTXO sets, withdrawal amounts, destination addresses, ERC20 logs, block heights, and RPC payloads to force an error path after partial mutation and verify the state transition rolls back completely; specifically, can this accept an external-chain log/UTXO/transaction under the wrong finality, address, token, or chain context, violating the invariant that minter operations must be idempotent across retries, reimbursements, and adapter/RPC inconsistencies, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/types/types/src/batch/chain_key.rs`::count_bytes
- Entrypoint: a canister requests Bitcoin/Ethereum/Dogecoin integration data through public management or adapter paths
- Attacker controls: deposit addresses, UTXO sets, withdrawal amounts, destination addresses, ERC20 logs, block heights, and RPC payloads
- Exploit idea: accept an external-chain log/UTXO/transaction under the wrong finality, address, token, or chain context
- Invariant to test: minter operations must be idempotent across retries, reimbursements, and adapter/RPC inconsistencies
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency
