# Q3443: execution: observe slice canonical encoding

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a canister creates nested callbacks, rejects, replies, and DTS pauses that reach execution scheduling and drive `rs/canister_sandbox/src/replica_controller/sandboxed_execution_controller.rs`::observe_slice with attacker-controlled message queues, response payloads, instruction limits, heap growth, and rollback-triggering traps to use alternative encodings or unknown fields so validation and execution interpret different values; specifically, can this cross a sandbox/system-api boundary with malformed memory references or encoded messages, violating the invariant that canister lifecycle operations must not bypass controller/effective-canister authorization, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/canister_sandbox/src/replica_controller/sandboxed_execution_controller.rs`::observe_slice
- Entrypoint: a canister creates nested callbacks, rejects, replies, and DTS pauses that reach execution scheduling
- Attacker controls: message queues, response payloads, instruction limits, heap growth, and rollback-triggering traps
- Exploit idea: cross a sandbox/system-api boundary with malformed memory references or encoded messages
- Invariant to test: canister lifecycle operations must not bypass controller/effective-canister authorization
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement
- Fast validation: run a state-machine test with crafted Wasm and assert state, cycles, callbacks, and certified data after trap/retry paths; add differential encode/decode cases for unknown fields, alternate lengths, and canonical hashes
