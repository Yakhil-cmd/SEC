# Q1011: Get Submitter evidence invariant edge f73b

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `GetSubmitter` in `sei-cosmos/x/evidence/types/msgs.go` via public evidence submission or validator evidence processing flow, controlling evidence bytes, validator identities, heights, timestamps, duplicate vote fields, and replay timing, and submit crafted evidence that is accepted as valid but maps to the wrong validator, height, or voting power so that the invariant `evidence validation must map deterministically to the correct validator, height, time, and voting power on all honest validators` fails, causing `Critical: Permanent freezing of user funds of USD $5,000 or more`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-cosmos/x/evidence/types/msgs.go:85` `GetSubmitter`
- Entrypoint: public evidence submission or validator evidence processing flow
- Attacker controls: evidence bytes, validator identities, heights, timestamps, duplicate vote fields, and replay timing
- Exploit idea: submit crafted evidence that is accepted as valid but maps to the wrong validator, height, or voting power
- Invariant to test: evidence validation must map deterministically to the correct validator, height, time, and voting power on all honest validators
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: Permanent freezing of user funds of USD $5,000 or more
- Fast validation: Submit duplicate/malformed evidence in a deterministic app test and assert validator mapping, slashing, app hash, and processing time are consistent.
