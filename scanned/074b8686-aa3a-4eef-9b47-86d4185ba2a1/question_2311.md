# Q2311: Set Next Base Fee Per Gas evm core invariant edge 4c47

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `SetNextBaseFeePerGas` in `x/evm/keeper/fee.go` via public EVM transaction through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, or DeliverTx, controlling EVM tx type, chain id, nonce, gas caps, access list, calldata, value, authorization list, and account association state, and trigger a revert/error path after partial fee, nonce, or balance updates and leave protocol accounting inconsistent so that the invariant `EVM ante, execution, receipts, nonce, balances, gas purchase/refund, and Cosmos state commits must be mutually consistent` fails, causing `Medium: Block production delay exceeding 2.5 seconds on realistic validator hardware, caused by crafted transactions or messages`?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/fee.go:91` `SetNextBaseFeePerGas`
- Entrypoint: public EVM transaction through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, or DeliverTx
- Attacker controls: EVM tx type, chain id, nonce, gas caps, access list, calldata, value, authorization list, and account association state
- Exploit idea: trigger a revert/error path after partial fee, nonce, or balance updates and leave protocol accounting inconsistent
- Invariant to test: EVM ante, execution, receipts, nonce, balances, gas purchase/refund, and Cosmos state commits must be mutually consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium: Block production delay exceeding 2.5 seconds on realistic validator hardware, caused by crafted transactions or messages
- Fast validation: Run the tx through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, DeliverTx, and receipt query paths, then diff nonce, balance, gas, logs, receipts, and committed state.
