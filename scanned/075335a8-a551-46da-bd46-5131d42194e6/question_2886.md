# Q2886: boundary: retriable rollback edge case

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a web client supplies hostnames, effective canister IDs, request IDs, certified asset paths, and ingress messages and drive `rs/boundary_node/ic_boundary/src/errors.rs`::retriable with attacker-controlled Candid/CBOR/protobuf payloads, WebAuthn fields, effective-canister ID, and boundary node request ordering to force an error path after partial mutation and verify the state transition rolls back completely; specifically, can this trigger non-volumetric platform-level crash via a malformed but protocol-valid API request, violating the invariant that read_state/query/certified asset responses must not be forgeable or stale beyond protocol rules, and produce HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/boundary_node/ic_boundary/src/errors.rs`::retriable
- Entrypoint: a web client supplies hostnames, effective canister IDs, request IDs, certified asset paths, and ingress messages
- Attacker controls: Candid/CBOR/protobuf payloads, WebAuthn fields, effective-canister ID, and boundary node request ordering
- Exploit idea: trigger non-volumetric platform-level crash via a malformed but protocol-valid API request
- Invariant to test: read_state/query/certified asset responses must not be forgeable or stale beyond protocol rules
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash
- Fast validation: send crafted HTTP/API requests in a local boundary/replica setup and compare validation, routing, and certification outputs
