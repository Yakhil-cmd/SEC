# Q1053: registry or orchestrator: check node record invariants canonical encoding

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a governance proposal or registry client submits node, subnet, routing-table, replica-version, or firewall mutations and drive `rs/registry/canister/src/invariants/node_record.rs`::check_node_record_invariants with attacker-controlled registry mutation payloads, node records, subnet membership, routing tables, replica versions, rewards data, and timestamps to use alternative encodings or unknown fields so validation and execution interpret different values; specifically, can this bypass node-key or endpoint validation to inject a record that affects consensus/boundary behavior, violating the invariant that registry mutations must preserve subnet membership, routing, key, version, and upgrade safety invariants, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: consensus configuration compromise, unauthorized node/governance effect, or significant infrastructure integrity loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/registry/canister/src/invariants/node_record.rs`::check_node_record_invariants
- Entrypoint: a governance proposal or registry client submits node, subnet, routing-table, replica-version, or firewall mutations
- Attacker controls: registry mutation payloads, node records, subnet membership, routing tables, replica versions, rewards data, and timestamps
- Exploit idea: bypass node-key or endpoint validation to inject a record that affects consensus/boundary behavior
- Invariant to test: registry mutations must preserve subnet membership, routing, key, version, and upgrade safety invariants
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: consensus configuration compromise, unauthorized node/governance effect, or significant infrastructure integrity loss
- Fast validation: construct registry mutation/orchestrator-consumer tests and assert invariant validation rejects malformed records; add differential encode/decode cases for unknown fields, alternate lengths, and canonical hashes
