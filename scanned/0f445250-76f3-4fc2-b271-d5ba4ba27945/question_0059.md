# Q0059: Cosmos Stateless Checks evm core invariant edge c86c

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `CosmosStatelessChecks` in `app/ante/cosmos_checktx.go` via public EVM transaction through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, or DeliverTx, controlling EVM tx type, chain id, nonce, gas caps, access list, calldata, value, authorization list, and account association state, and use transaction type edge cases to pass one validator path and fail another with different state side effects so that the invariant `all validators must reject or accept the same public EVM transaction with the same state side effects` fails, causing `Medium: Block production delay exceeding 2.5 seconds on realistic validator hardware, caused by crafted transactions or messages`?

## Target
- File/function: `app/ante/cosmos_checktx.go:136` `CosmosStatelessChecks`
- Entrypoint: public EVM transaction through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, or DeliverTx
- Attacker controls: EVM tx type, chain id, nonce, gas caps, access list, calldata, value, authorization list, and account association state
- Exploit idea: use transaction type edge cases to pass one validator path and fail another with different state side effects
- Invariant to test: all validators must reject or accept the same public EVM transaction with the same state side effects
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium: Block production delay exceeding 2.5 seconds on realistic validator hardware, caused by crafted transactions or messages
- Fast validation: Run the tx through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, DeliverTx, and receipt query paths, then diff nonce, balance, gas, logs, receipts, and committed state.
