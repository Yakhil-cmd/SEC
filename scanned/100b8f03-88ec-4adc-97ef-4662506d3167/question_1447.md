# Q1447: crypto: Dkg Create Transcript Error ordering/race

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a boundary/API caller submits WebAuthn, canister-signature, TLS, or basic-signature material and drive `rs/types/types/src/crypto/threshold_sig/ni_dkg/errors/create_transcript_error.rs`::DkgCreateTranscriptError with attacker-controlled transcripts, dealings, complaints, openings, signature shares, derivation paths, and message bytes to reorder callbacks, gossip artifacts, or timer events to violate exactly-once semantics; specifically, can this cause complaint/opening handling to retain, remove, or reveal key material under wrong transcript IDs, violating the invariant that cryptographic verification must bind message, domain, signer set, registry version, and transcript ID, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/types/types/src/crypto/threshold_sig/ni_dkg/errors/create_transcript_error.rs`::DkgCreateTranscriptError
- Entrypoint: a boundary/API caller submits WebAuthn, canister-signature, TLS, or basic-signature material
- Attacker controls: transcripts, dealings, complaints, openings, signature shares, derivation paths, and message bytes
- Exploit idea: cause complaint/opening handling to retain, remove, or reveal key material under wrong transcript IDs
- Invariant to test: cryptographic verification must bind message, domain, signer set, registry version, and transcript ID
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass
- Fast validation: fuzz encodings/transcripts/signature shares and assert verification rejects cross-domain or malformed variants
