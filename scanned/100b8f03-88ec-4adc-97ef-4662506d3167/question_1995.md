# Q1995: consensus: Dkg Pool Impl cross module mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a below-threshold protocol peer replays notarization/finalization/CUP artifacts and drive `rs/artifact_pool/src/dkg_pool.rs`::DkgPoolImpl with attacker-controlled ingress batches, payload limits, expiry windows, and repeated admissible messages to make producer and consumer modules disagree on height, registry version, state hash, or authorization context; specifically, can this race purge/admission logic so a stale but well-formed artifact influences finalization, violating the invariant that payload validation must bind ingress, xnet, canister HTTP, and chain-key sections to the same context, and produce HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/artifact_pool/src/dkg_pool.rs`::DkgPoolImpl
- Entrypoint: a below-threshold protocol peer replays notarization/finalization/CUP artifacts
- Attacker controls: ingress batches, payload limits, expiry windows, and repeated admissible messages
- Exploit idea: race purge/admission logic so a stale but well-formed artifact influences finalization
- Invariant to test: payload validation must bind ingress, xnet, canister HTTP, and chain-key sections to the same context
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization
- Fast validation: construct a local consensus/pool test with two artifact arrival orders and assert identical validation/finalization results
