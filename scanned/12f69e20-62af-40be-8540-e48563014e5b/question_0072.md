# Q72: consensus: save replay/idempotency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a canister HTTP participant supplies divergent responses that enter consensus payload building and drive `rs/artifact_pool/src/lmdb_pool.rs`::save with attacker-controlled artifact bytes, heights, registry versions, validation context, and timing/order of gossip to replay, repeat, or race an accepted message so the side effect is applied twice or cleanup is skipped; specifically, can this make validation accept an artifact whose dependencies or height context differ across honest replicas, violating the invariant that honest replicas must not finalize or notarize a block that fails deterministic validation, and produce HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/artifact_pool/src/lmdb_pool.rs`::save
- Entrypoint: a canister HTTP participant supplies divergent responses that enter consensus payload building
- Attacker controls: artifact bytes, heights, registry versions, validation context, and timing/order of gossip
- Exploit idea: make validation accept an artifact whose dependencies or height context differ across honest replicas
- Invariant to test: honest replicas must not finalize or notarize a block that fails deterministic validation
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization
- Fast validation: construct a local consensus/pool test with two artifact arrival orders and assert identical validation/finalization results; repeat the same request before and after callback/timer boundaries and assert exactly-once effects
