# Q1968: consensus: get parent block bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a canister HTTP participant supplies divergent responses that enter consensus payload building and drive `rs/artifact_pool/src/consensus_pool_cache.rs`::get_parent_block with attacker-controlled artifact bytes, heights, registry versions, validation context, and timing/order of gossip to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this trigger inconsistent handling of oversized or duplicated payload sections before notarization, violating the invariant that honest replicas must not finalize or notarize a block that fails deterministic validation, and produce HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/artifact_pool/src/consensus_pool_cache.rs`::get_parent_block
- Entrypoint: a canister HTTP participant supplies divergent responses that enter consensus payload building
- Attacker controls: artifact bytes, heights, registry versions, validation context, and timing/order of gossip
- Exploit idea: trigger inconsistent handling of oversized or duplicated payload sections before notarization
- Invariant to test: honest replicas must not finalize or notarize a block that fails deterministic validation
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization
- Fast validation: construct a local consensus/pool test with two artifact arrival orders and assert identical validation/finalization results; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
