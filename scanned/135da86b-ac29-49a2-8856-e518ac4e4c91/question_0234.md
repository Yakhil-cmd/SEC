# Q234: execution: split resource accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an ingress sender installs or upgrades a crafted Wasm module through management-canister flows and drive `rs/canister_sandbox/src/transport.rs`::split with attacker-controlled install/upgrade payloads, canister settings, controllers, memory pages, and execution round timing to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this exploit a DTS pause/resume boundary to reuse stale execution state or duplicate a response, violating the invariant that instruction, memory, and cycles accounting must remain conserved across retries and callbacks, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/canister_sandbox/src/transport.rs`::split
- Entrypoint: an ingress sender installs or upgrades a crafted Wasm module through management-canister flows
- Attacker controls: install/upgrade payloads, canister settings, controllers, memory pages, and execution round timing
- Exploit idea: exploit a DTS pause/resume boundary to reuse stale execution state or duplicate a response
- Invariant to test: instruction, memory, and cycles accounting must remain conserved across retries and callbacks
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement
- Fast validation: run a state-machine test with crafted Wasm and assert state, cycles, callbacks, and certified data after trap/retry paths
