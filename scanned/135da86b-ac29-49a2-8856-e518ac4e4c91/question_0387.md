# Q387: crypto: signing ordering/race

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through public signature or threshold-signing request path and drive `rs/crypto/internal/crypto_lib/threshold_sig/canister_threshold_sig/src/signing.rs`::signing with attacker-controlled transcripts, dealings, complaints, openings, signature shares, derivation paths, and message bytes to reorder callbacks, gossip artifacts, or timer events to violate exactly-once semantics; specifically, can this bypass subgroup, canonical encoding, or domain-separation checks for a threshold-signature operation, violating the invariant that cryptographic verification must bind message, domain, signer set, registry version, and transcript ID, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/crypto/internal/crypto_lib/threshold_sig/canister_threshold_sig/src/signing.rs`::signing
- Entrypoint: public signature or threshold-signing request path
- Attacker controls: transcripts, dealings, complaints, openings, signature shares, derivation paths, and message bytes
- Exploit idea: bypass subgroup, canonical encoding, or domain-separation checks for a threshold-signature operation
- Invariant to test: cryptographic verification must bind message, domain, signer set, registry version, and transcript ID
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass
- Fast validation: fuzz encodings/transcripts/signature shares and assert verification rejects cross-domain or malformed variants
