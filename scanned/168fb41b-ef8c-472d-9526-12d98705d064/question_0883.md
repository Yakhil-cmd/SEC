# Q0883: Validate Basic feegrant invariant edge f4a4

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `ValidateBasic` in `sei-cosmos/x/feegrant/msgs.go` via public feegrant allowance creation, use, pruning, or revocation flow, controlling granter/grantee addresses, allowance types, spend limits, expiration, fee denom, and transaction fee selection, and force allowance pruning or validation into panic/unbounded work through public grant parameters so that the invariant `failed or reordered transactions must not consume or avoid consuming allowances inconsistently with fee charging` fails, causing `Low: Manipulation of transaction fee calculation resulting in fees outside protocol-defined bounds`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-cosmos/x/feegrant/msgs.go:39` `ValidateBasic`
- Entrypoint: public feegrant allowance creation, use, pruning, or revocation flow
- Attacker controls: granter/grantee addresses, allowance types, spend limits, expiration, fee denom, and transaction fee selection
- Exploit idea: force allowance pruning or validation into panic/unbounded work through public grant parameters
- Invariant to test: failed or reordered transactions must not consume or avoid consuming allowances inconsistently with fee charging
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low: Manipulation of transaction fee calculation resulting in fees outside protocol-defined bounds
- Fast validation: Create feegrant allowances, execute paid and failing transactions with edge fees, and assert allowance consumption equals actual protocol fee deduction.
