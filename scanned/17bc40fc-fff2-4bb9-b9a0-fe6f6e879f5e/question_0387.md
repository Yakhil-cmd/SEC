# Q0387: New Keeper staking invariant edge dcc8

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `NewKeeper` in `sei-cosmos/x/slashing/keeper/keeper.go` via public staking, delegation, undelegation, redelegation, evidence, or slashing message flow, controlling delegator/validator addresses, shares, denom amounts, redelegation targets, unbonding timing, evidence payloads, and message ordering, and break delegation, share, unbonding, redelegation, or slashing accounting through ordering and rounding edge cases so that the invariant `public staking/evidence flows must not slash, freeze, or move funds for the wrong account or validator` fails, causing `High: Network not being able to confirm new transactions from total shutdown or consensus failure`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-cosmos/x/slashing/keeper/keeper.go:24` `NewKeeper`
- Entrypoint: public staking, delegation, undelegation, redelegation, evidence, or slashing message flow
- Attacker controls: delegator/validator addresses, shares, denom amounts, redelegation targets, unbonding timing, evidence payloads, and message ordering
- Exploit idea: break delegation, share, unbonding, redelegation, or slashing accounting through ordering and rounding edge cases
- Invariant to test: public staking/evidence flows must not slash, freeze, or move funds for the wrong account or validator
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: Network not being able to confirm new transactions from total shutdown or consensus failure
- Fast validation: Create a state-machine test around delegation/redelegation/unbonding/evidence ordering and assert shares, tokens, power, slashing, and unbonding queues stay consistent.
