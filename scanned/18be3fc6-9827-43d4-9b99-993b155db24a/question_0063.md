# Q0063: Get mempool invariant edge 3346

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Get` in `sei-tendermint/internal/mempool/cache.go` via public transaction gossip, CheckTx, or mempool recheck flow, controlling transaction bytes, nonce/order, gas values, signatures, account sequence, message mix, and repeated submission timing, and craft payload sizes and gas declarations that bypass CheckTx limits but force expensive proposal or block validation work so that the invariant `transactions admitted to the mempool must either be cheap to reject later or pay protocol-defined fees for consumed resources` fails, causing `Medium: Block production delay exceeding 2.5 seconds on realistic validator hardware, caused by crafted transactions or messages`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-tendermint/internal/mempool/cache.go:59` `Get`
- Entrypoint: public transaction gossip, CheckTx, or mempool recheck flow
- Attacker controls: transaction bytes, nonce/order, gas values, signatures, account sequence, message mix, and repeated submission timing
- Exploit idea: craft payload sizes and gas declarations that bypass CheckTx limits but force expensive proposal or block validation work
- Invariant to test: transactions admitted to the mempool must either be cheap to reject later or pay protocol-defined fees for consumed resources
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium: Block production delay exceeding 2.5 seconds on realistic validator hardware, caused by crafted transactions or messages
- Fast validation: Submit crafted tx bytes through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, and DeliverTx with default config, then compare admission, rejection point, fees, nonce, and elapsed validation time.
