# Q1069: registry or orchestrator: do create subnet certification/witness

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a governance proposal or registry client submits node, subnet, routing-table, replica-version, or firewall mutations and drive `rs/registry/canister/src/mutations/do_create_subnet.rs`::do_create_subnet with attacker-controlled node public keys, TLS certs, endpoints, proposal payloads, upgrade metadata, and registry deltas to request or construct certified data with ambiguous paths, labels, or stale state; specifically, can this bypass node-key or endpoint validation to inject a record that affects consensus/boundary behavior, violating the invariant that registry mutations must preserve subnet membership, routing, key, version, and upgrade safety invariants, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: consensus configuration compromise, unauthorized node/governance effect, or significant infrastructure integrity loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/registry/canister/src/mutations/do_create_subnet.rs`::do_create_subnet
- Entrypoint: a governance proposal or registry client submits node, subnet, routing-table, replica-version, or firewall mutations
- Attacker controls: node public keys, TLS certs, endpoints, proposal payloads, upgrade metadata, and registry deltas
- Exploit idea: bypass node-key or endpoint validation to inject a record that affects consensus/boundary behavior
- Invariant to test: registry mutations must preserve subnet membership, routing, key, version, and upgrade safety invariants
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: consensus configuration compromise, unauthorized node/governance effect, or significant infrastructure integrity loss
- Fast validation: construct registry mutation/orchestrator-consumer tests and assert invariant validation rejects malformed records
