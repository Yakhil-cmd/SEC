# Q2251: chain fusion: get max number of connections authorization boundary

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a caller controls UTXOs, Ethereum logs, RPC responses, transaction IDs, memos, fees, and retry timing and drive `rs/bitcoin/adapter/src/connectionmanager.rs`::get_max_number_of_connections with attacker-controlled minter state transitions, retry ordering, chain-key signature requests, and external-chain transaction encodings to bypass authorization by desynchronizing caller identity, effective canister/account, and validated state; specifically, can this cause minter and ledger state to diverge after a failed withdrawal, reimbursement, or callback retry, violating the invariant that external-chain evidence must be bound to chain, token, address, finality, and ledger account context, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/adapter/src/connectionmanager.rs`::get_max_number_of_connections
- Entrypoint: a caller controls UTXOs, Ethereum logs, RPC responses, transaction IDs, memos, fees, and retry timing
- Attacker controls: minter state transitions, retry ordering, chain-key signature requests, and external-chain transaction encodings
- Exploit idea: cause minter and ledger state to diverge after a failed withdrawal, reimbursement, or callback retry
- Invariant to test: external-chain evidence must be bound to chain, token, address, finality, and ledger account context
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency
