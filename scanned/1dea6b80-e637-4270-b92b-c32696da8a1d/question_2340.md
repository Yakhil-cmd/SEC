# Q2340: chain fusion: Transaction Store signature/domain

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a protocol peer or adapter client supplies chain-fusion payloads that enter consensus or minter state and drive `rs/bitcoin/adapter/src/transaction_store.rs`::TransactionStore with attacker-controlled deposit addresses, UTXO sets, withdrawal amounts, destination addresses, ERC20 logs, block heights, and RPC payloads to reuse signatures, transcripts, or request IDs across domains, algorithms, or registry versions; specifically, can this accept an external-chain log/UTXO/transaction under the wrong finality, address, token, or chain context, violating the invariant that threshold signing must only authorize transactions derived from valid minter state, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/adapter/src/transaction_store.rs`::TransactionStore
- Entrypoint: a protocol peer or adapter client supplies chain-fusion payloads that enter consensus or minter state
- Attacker controls: deposit addresses, UTXO sets, withdrawal amounts, destination addresses, ERC20 logs, block heights, and RPC payloads
- Exploit idea: accept an external-chain log/UTXO/transaction under the wrong finality, address, token, or chain context
- Invariant to test: threshold signing must only authorize transactions derived from valid minter state
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency; mutate domain separators, registry versions, signer IDs, and message bytes independently
