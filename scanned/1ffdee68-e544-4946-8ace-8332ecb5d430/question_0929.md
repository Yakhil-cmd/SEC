# Q0929: Type evidence invariant edge e418

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Type` in `sei-cosmos/x/evidence/types/msgs.go` via public evidence submission or validator evidence processing flow, controlling evidence bytes, validator identities, heights, timestamps, duplicate vote fields, and replay timing, and force evidence validation into deterministic excessive work or panic using public evidence bytes so that the invariant `evidence replay or malformed fields must not cause wrong slashing, chain halt, or excessive validation work` fails, causing `High: Network not being able to confirm new transactions from total shutdown or consensus failure`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-cosmos/x/evidence/types/msgs.go:42` `Type`
- Entrypoint: public evidence submission or validator evidence processing flow
- Attacker controls: evidence bytes, validator identities, heights, timestamps, duplicate vote fields, and replay timing
- Exploit idea: force evidence validation into deterministic excessive work or panic using public evidence bytes
- Invariant to test: evidence replay or malformed fields must not cause wrong slashing, chain halt, or excessive validation work
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: Network not being able to confirm new transactions from total shutdown or consensus failure
- Fast validation: Submit duplicate/malformed evidence in a deterministic app test and assert validator mapping, slashing, app hash, and processing time are consistent.
