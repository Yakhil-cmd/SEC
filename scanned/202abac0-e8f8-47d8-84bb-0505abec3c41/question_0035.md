# Q35: ledger: mod cross module mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a spender races allowance, transfer_from, fee, memo, timestamp, and duplicate transaction windows and drive `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc103/mod.rs`::mod with attacker-controlled Rosetta construction payloads, transaction identifiers, block ranges, ledger responses, and retry timing to make producer and consumer modules disagree on height, registry version, state hash, or authorization context; specifically, can this confuse account/subaccount encoding so authorization or accounting applies to the wrong account, violating the invariant that ledger balances plus fees must be conserved across transfer, approve, transfer_from, archive, and index paths, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc103/mod.rs`::mod
- Entrypoint: a spender races allowance, transfer_from, fee, memo, timestamp, and duplicate transaction windows
- Attacker controls: Rosetta construction payloads, transaction identifiers, block ranges, ledger responses, and retry timing
- Exploit idea: confuse account/subaccount encoding so authorization or accounting applies to the wrong account
- Invariant to test: ledger balances plus fees must be conserved across transfer, approve, transfer_from, archive, and index paths
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs
