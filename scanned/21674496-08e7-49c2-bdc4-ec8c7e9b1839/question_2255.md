# Q2255: chain fusion: reap disconnected cross module mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a caller controls UTXOs, Ethereum logs, RPC responses, transaction IDs, memos, fees, and retry timing and drive `rs/bitcoin/adapter/src/connectionmanager.rs`::reap_disconnected with attacker-controlled deposit addresses, UTXO sets, withdrawal amounts, destination addresses, ERC20 logs, block heights, and RPC payloads to make producer and consumer modules disagree on height, registry version, state hash, or authorization context; specifically, can this cause minter and ledger state to diverge after a failed withdrawal, reimbursement, or callback retry, violating the invariant that external-chain evidence must be bound to chain, token, address, finality, and ledger account context, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/adapter/src/connectionmanager.rs`::reap_disconnected
- Entrypoint: a caller controls UTXOs, Ethereum logs, RPC responses, transaction IDs, memos, fees, and retry timing
- Attacker controls: deposit addresses, UTXO sets, withdrawal amounts, destination addresses, ERC20 logs, block heights, and RPC payloads
- Exploit idea: cause minter and ledger state to diverge after a failed withdrawal, reimbursement, or callback retry
- Invariant to test: external-chain evidence must be bound to chain, token, address, finality, and ledger account context
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency
