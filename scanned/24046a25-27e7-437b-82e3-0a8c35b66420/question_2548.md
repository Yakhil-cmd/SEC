# Q2548: chain fusion: Num Utxos Histogram bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a protocol peer or adapter client supplies chain-fusion payloads that enter consensus or minter state and drive `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/metrics.rs`::NumUtxosHistogram with attacker-controlled minter state transitions, retry ordering, chain-key signature requests, and external-chain transaction encodings to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this cause minter and ledger state to diverge after a failed withdrawal, reimbursement, or callback retry, violating the invariant that threshold signing must only authorize transactions derived from valid minter state, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/metrics.rs`::NumUtxosHistogram
- Entrypoint: a protocol peer or adapter client supplies chain-fusion payloads that enter consensus or minter state
- Attacker controls: minter state transitions, retry ordering, chain-key signature requests, and external-chain transaction encodings
- Exploit idea: cause minter and ledger state to diverge after a failed withdrawal, reimbursement, or callback retry
- Invariant to test: threshold signing must only authorize transactions derived from valid minter state
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
