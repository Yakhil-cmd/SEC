# Q1412: types packages: truncate content replay/idempotency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a Rosetta/ICRC/management-canister caller supplies edge-case type values that flow into production logic and drive `rs/types/types/src/canister_log.rs`::truncate_content with attacker-controlled serialization round trips, canonical ordering, domain separators, and request identifiers to replay, repeat, or race an accepted message so the side effect is applied twice or cleanup is skipped; specifically, can this overflow, truncate, or normalize security-critical fields before authorization or accounting checks, violating the invariant that numeric/account/principal conversions must not truncate, alias, or bypass authorization/accounting checks, and produce HackenProof High/Medium: authorization bypass, accounting mismatch, signature confusion, or production platform crash?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/types/types/src/canister_log.rs`::truncate_content
- Entrypoint: a Rosetta/ICRC/management-canister caller supplies edge-case type values that flow into production logic
- Attacker controls: serialization round trips, canonical ordering, domain separators, and request identifiers
- Exploit idea: overflow, truncate, or normalize security-critical fields before authorization or accounting checks
- Invariant to test: numeric/account/principal conversions must not truncate, alias, or bypass authorization/accounting checks
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Medium: authorization bypass, accounting mismatch, signature confusion, or production platform crash
- Fast validation: fuzz type round trips and differential consumers, then assert canonical equality, rejection, and no overflow/aliasing; repeat the same request before and after callback/timer boundaries and assert exactly-once effects
