# Q284: consensus: invoke state sync resource accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through state-sync peer/chunk path and drive `rs/consensus/src/consensus/catchup_package_maker.rs`::invoke_state_sync with attacker-controlled artifact bytes, heights, registry versions, validation context, and timing/order of gossip to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this race purge/admission logic so a stale but well-formed artifact influences finalization, violating the invariant that honest replicas must not finalize or notarize a block that fails deterministic validation, and produce HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/consensus/src/consensus/catchup_package_maker.rs`::invoke_state_sync
- Entrypoint: state-sync peer/chunk path
- Attacker controls: artifact bytes, heights, registry versions, validation context, and timing/order of gossip
- Exploit idea: race purge/admission logic so a stale but well-formed artifact influences finalization
- Invariant to test: honest replicas must not finalize or notarize a block that fails deterministic validation
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization
- Fast validation: construct a local consensus/pool test with two artifact arrival orders and assert identical validation/finalization results
