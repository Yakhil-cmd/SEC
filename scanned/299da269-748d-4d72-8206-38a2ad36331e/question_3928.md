# Q3928: Empty evm core invariant edge 5d07

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Empty` in `x/evm/state/check.go` via public EVM transaction through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, or DeliverTx, controlling EVM tx type, chain id, nonce, gas caps, access list, calldata, value, authorization list, and account association state, and use transaction type edge cases to pass one validator path and fail another with different state side effects so that the invariant `EVM ante, execution, receipts, nonce, balances, gas purchase/refund, and Cosmos state commits must be mutually consistent` fails, causing `Critical: Direct loss of user funds of USD $5,000 or more, excluding gas fees and yield`?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/state/check.go:34` `Empty`
- Entrypoint: public EVM transaction through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, or DeliverTx
- Attacker controls: EVM tx type, chain id, nonce, gas caps, access list, calldata, value, authorization list, and account association state
- Exploit idea: use transaction type edge cases to pass one validator path and fail another with different state side effects
- Invariant to test: EVM ante, execution, receipts, nonce, balances, gas purchase/refund, and Cosmos state commits must be mutually consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: Direct loss of user funds of USD $5,000 or more, excluding gas fees and yield
- Fast validation: Run the tx through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, DeliverTx, and receipt query paths, then diff nonce, balance, gas, logs, receipts, and committed state.
