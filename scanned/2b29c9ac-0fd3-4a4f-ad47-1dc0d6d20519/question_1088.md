# Q1088: registry or orchestrator: do update node directly bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a boundary/node rewards caller submits public canister/API requests affecting registry-derived state and drive `rs/registry/canister/src/mutations/do_update_node_directly.rs`::do_update_node_directly with attacker-controlled registry mutation payloads, node records, subnet membership, routing tables, replica versions, rewards data, and timestamps to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this make validation accept a registry mutation that violates subnet, key, routing, or upgrade invariants, violating the invariant that configuration changes must be authorized, validated, and consumed consistently by all replicas, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: consensus configuration compromise, unauthorized node/governance effect, or significant infrastructure integrity loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/registry/canister/src/mutations/do_update_node_directly.rs`::do_update_node_directly
- Entrypoint: a boundary/node rewards caller submits public canister/API requests affecting registry-derived state
- Attacker controls: registry mutation payloads, node records, subnet membership, routing tables, replica versions, rewards data, and timestamps
- Exploit idea: make validation accept a registry mutation that violates subnet, key, routing, or upgrade invariants
- Invariant to test: configuration changes must be authorized, validated, and consumed consistently by all replicas
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: consensus configuration compromise, unauthorized node/governance effect, or significant infrastructure integrity loss
- Fast validation: construct registry mutation/orchestrator-consumer tests and assert invariant validation rejects malformed records; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
