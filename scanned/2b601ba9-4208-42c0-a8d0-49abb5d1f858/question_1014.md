# Q1014: consensus: add peer resource accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an unprivileged ingress sender fills payload candidates that reach consensus validation and drive `rs/p2p/memory_transport/src/lib.rs`::add_peer with attacker-controlled ingress batches, payload limits, expiry windows, and repeated admissible messages to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this trigger inconsistent handling of oversized or duplicated payload sections before notarization, violating the invariant that below-threshold peers must not break consensus safety, liveness, or finalized chain uniqueness, and produce HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/p2p/memory_transport/src/lib.rs`::add_peer
- Entrypoint: an unprivileged ingress sender fills payload candidates that reach consensus validation
- Attacker controls: ingress batches, payload limits, expiry windows, and repeated admissible messages
- Exploit idea: trigger inconsistent handling of oversized or duplicated payload sections before notarization
- Invariant to test: below-threshold peers must not break consensus safety, liveness, or finalized chain uniqueness
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization
- Fast validation: construct a local consensus/pool test with two artifact arrival orders and assert identical validation/finalization results
