# Q1294: ledger: get state from network id resource accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an exchange/client sends Rosetta API requests with crafted operations, blocks, metadata, or signatures and drive `rs/rosetta-api/icrc1/src/common/utils/utils.rs`::get_state_from_network_id with attacker-controlled Rosetta construction payloads, transaction identifiers, block ranges, ledger responses, and retry timing to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this confuse account/subaccount encoding so authorization or accounting applies to the wrong account, violating the invariant that archive and index views must not create spendable balance or hide finalized debits, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/rosetta-api/icrc1/src/common/utils/utils.rs`::get_state_from_network_id
- Entrypoint: an exchange/client sends Rosetta API requests with crafted operations, blocks, metadata, or signatures
- Attacker controls: Rosetta construction payloads, transaction identifiers, block ranges, ledger responses, and retry timing
- Exploit idea: confuse account/subaccount encoding so authorization or accounting applies to the wrong account
- Invariant to test: archive and index views must not create spendable balance or hide finalized debits
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs
