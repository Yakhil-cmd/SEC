# Q0572: Wasmd VK app tx invariant edge 1848

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `WasmdVK` in `app/precompiles.go` via public Cosmos/EVM transaction processed by BaseApp and ante handlers, controlling transaction bytes, signatures, fee fields, message ordering, extension options, gas limits, and account sequence values, and bypass extension option, signature, fee, or gas invariants by combining EVM and Cosmos message forms so that the invariant `transaction bytes, signatures, fees, gas, message validation, and execution must be interpreted consistently across CheckTx and DeliverTx` fails, causing `Medium: Block production delay exceeding 2.5 seconds on realistic validator hardware, caused by crafted transactions or messages`?

## Target
- File/function: `app/precompiles.go:60` `WasmdVK`
- Entrypoint: public Cosmos/EVM transaction processed by BaseApp and ante handlers
- Attacker controls: transaction bytes, signatures, fee fields, message ordering, extension options, gas limits, and account sequence values
- Exploit idea: bypass extension option, signature, fee, or gas invariants by combining EVM and Cosmos message forms
- Invariant to test: transaction bytes, signatures, fees, gas, message validation, and execution must be interpreted consistently across CheckTx and DeliverTx
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium: Block production delay exceeding 2.5 seconds on realistic validator hardware, caused by crafted transactions or messages
- Fast validation: Encode the transaction through the app TxConfig, execute CheckTx and FinalizeBlock/DeliverTx, and assert fees, gas, sequence, and state changes match the same interpretation.
