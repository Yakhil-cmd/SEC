# Q2104: consensus: tx insert resource accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a canister HTTP participant supplies divergent responses that enter consensus payload building and drive `rs/artifact_pool/src/lmdb_pool.rs`::tx_insert with attacker-controlled artifact bytes, heights, registry versions, validation context, and timing/order of gossip to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this make validation accept an artifact whose dependencies or height context differ across honest replicas, violating the invariant that honest replicas must not finalize or notarize a block that fails deterministic validation, and produce HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/artifact_pool/src/lmdb_pool.rs`::tx_insert
- Entrypoint: a canister HTTP participant supplies divergent responses that enter consensus payload building
- Attacker controls: artifact bytes, heights, registry versions, validation context, and timing/order of gossip
- Exploit idea: make validation accept an artifact whose dependencies or height context differ across honest replicas
- Invariant to test: honest replicas must not finalize or notarize a block that fails deterministic validation
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization
- Fast validation: construct a local consensus/pool test with two artifact arrival orders and assert identical validation/finalization results
