# Q1436: bind Ibc Port wasm invariant edge 17e6

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `bindIbcPort` in `sei-wasmd/x/wasm/keeper/ibc.go` via public CosmWasm instantiate, execute, migrate-restricted user flow, query, or EVM/wasm binding call, controlling contract msg JSON, funds, reply/submessage behavior, query payloads, contract address inputs, and EVM/wasm conversion data, and make EVM/wasm address conversion or callback ordering freeze, steal, or mis-account user funds so that the invariant `wasm-controlled native bindings, funds movement, replies, and rollbacks must be atomic with contract execution results` fails, causing `Critical: Direct loss of user funds of USD $5,000 or more, excluding gas fees and yield`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-wasmd/x/wasm/keeper/ibc.go:17` `bindIbcPort`
- Entrypoint: public CosmWasm instantiate, execute, migrate-restricted user flow, query, or EVM/wasm binding call
- Attacker controls: contract msg JSON, funds, reply/submessage behavior, query payloads, contract address inputs, and EVM/wasm conversion data
- Exploit idea: make EVM/wasm address conversion or callback ordering freeze, steal, or mis-account user funds
- Invariant to test: wasm-controlled native bindings, funds movement, replies, and rollbacks must be atomic with contract execution results
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: Direct loss of user funds of USD $5,000 or more, excluding gas fees and yield
- Fast validation: Deploy a minimal contract that emits the target binding/submessage/query, force success and failure paths, and assert native state rolls back or commits atomically.
