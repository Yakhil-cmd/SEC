# Q1269: ledger: retriable certification/witness

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a ledger user submits ICRC/ICP transfer, approve, transfer_from, archive, index, or Rosetta construction calls and drive `rs/rosetta-api/icp/src/request/transaction_results.rs`::retriable with attacker-controlled ICRC metadata, allowance expirations, archive callbacks, index sync heights, and duplicate detection fields to request or construct certified data with ambiguous paths, labels, or stale state; specifically, can this make ledger, archive, index, or Rosetta derive different balances or transaction IDs for one operation, violating the invariant that duplicate/replay windows must reject repeated value movement under all encodings, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/rosetta-api/icp/src/request/transaction_results.rs`::retriable
- Entrypoint: a ledger user submits ICRC/ICP transfer, approve, transfer_from, archive, index, or Rosetta construction calls
- Attacker controls: ICRC metadata, allowance expirations, archive callbacks, index sync heights, and duplicate detection fields
- Exploit idea: make ledger, archive, index, or Rosetta derive different balances or transaction IDs for one operation
- Invariant to test: duplicate/replay windows must reject repeated value movement under all encodings
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs
