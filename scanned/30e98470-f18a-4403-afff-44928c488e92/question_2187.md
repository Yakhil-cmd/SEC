# Q2187: chain fusion: add headers ordering/race

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a caller controls UTXOs, Ethereum logs, RPC responses, transaction IDs, memos, fees, and retry timing and drive `rs/bitcoin/adapter/src/blockchainstate.rs`::add_headers with attacker-controlled memos, reimbursement IDs, transaction status, fee estimates, finality depth, adapter responses, and ledger callbacks to reorder callbacks, gossip artifacts, or timer events to violate exactly-once semantics; specifically, can this obtain a chain-key signature for a transaction not authorized by the finalized minter state, violating the invariant that external-chain evidence must be bound to chain, token, address, finality, and ledger account context, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/adapter/src/blockchainstate.rs`::add_headers
- Entrypoint: a caller controls UTXOs, Ethereum logs, RPC responses, transaction IDs, memos, fees, and retry timing
- Attacker controls: memos, reimbursement IDs, transaction status, fee estimates, finality depth, adapter responses, and ledger callbacks
- Exploit idea: obtain a chain-key signature for a transaction not authorized by the finalized minter state
- Invariant to test: external-chain evidence must be bound to chain, token, address, finality, and ledger account context
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency
