# Q1031: registry or orchestrator: add deltas authorization boundary

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an orchestrator consumes registry updates, CUPs, upgrade images, and node configuration from replicated state and drive `rs/registry/canister-client/src/stable_canister_client.rs`::add_deltas with attacker-controlled NNS-approved but attacker-crafted record fields, ordering of deltas, and retry timing around upgrades to bypass authorization by desynchronizing caller identity, effective canister/account, and validated state; specifically, can this double-apply or skip a rewards/configuration transition due to malformed registry-derived state, violating the invariant that node and boundary records must not allow unauthorized participation or reward/accounting effects, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: consensus configuration compromise, unauthorized node/governance effect, or significant infrastructure integrity loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/registry/canister-client/src/stable_canister_client.rs`::add_deltas
- Entrypoint: an orchestrator consumes registry updates, CUPs, upgrade images, and node configuration from replicated state
- Attacker controls: NNS-approved but attacker-crafted record fields, ordering of deltas, and retry timing around upgrades
- Exploit idea: double-apply or skip a rewards/configuration transition due to malformed registry-derived state
- Invariant to test: node and boundary records must not allow unauthorized participation or reward/accounting effects
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: consensus configuration compromise, unauthorized node/governance effect, or significant infrastructure integrity loss
- Fast validation: construct registry mutation/orchestrator-consumer tests and assert invariant validation rejects malformed records
