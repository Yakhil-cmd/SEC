# Q1276: ledger: construction payloads rollback edge case

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a caller queries archive/index state while ledger blocks are being appended or synchronized and drive `rs/rosetta-api/icp/src/request_handler/construction_payloads.rs`::construction_payloads with attacker-controlled accounts, subaccounts, spender, amount, fee, memo, created_at_time, block index, operation order, and signatures to force an error path after partial mutation and verify the state transition rolls back completely; specifically, can this undercharge fees or mis-handle refunds when transfer/approval state changes across retries, violating the invariant that Rosetta construction/parse/submit must map one signed transaction to one ledger effect, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/rosetta-api/icp/src/request_handler/construction_payloads.rs`::construction_payloads
- Entrypoint: a caller queries archive/index state while ledger blocks are being appended or synchronized
- Attacker controls: accounts, subaccounts, spender, amount, fee, memo, created_at_time, block index, operation order, and signatures
- Exploit idea: undercharge fees or mis-handle refunds when transfer/approval state changes across retries
- Invariant to test: Rosetta construction/parse/submit must map one signed transaction to one ledger effect
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs
