# Q125: chain fusion: get withdrawal account cross module mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through public withdrawal flow and drive `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/updates/get_withdrawal_account.rs`::get_withdrawal_account with attacker-controlled minter state transitions, retry ordering, chain-key signature requests, and external-chain transaction encodings to make producer and consumer modules disagree on height, registry version, state hash, or authorization context; specifically, can this cause minter and ledger state to diverge after a failed withdrawal, reimbursement, or callback retry, violating the invariant that ck-token supply must be conserved against finalized external-chain deposits and withdrawals, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/updates/get_withdrawal_account.rs`::get_withdrawal_account
- Entrypoint: public withdrawal flow
- Attacker controls: minter state transitions, retry ordering, chain-key signature requests, and external-chain transaction encodings
- Exploit idea: cause minter and ledger state to diverge after a failed withdrawal, reimbursement, or callback retry
- Invariant to test: ck-token supply must be conserved against finalized external-chain deposits and withdrawals
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency
