# Q1247: ledger: handle spawn ordering/race

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a spender races allowance, transfer_from, fee, memo, timestamp, and duplicate transaction windows and drive `rs/rosetta-api/icp/src/ledger_client/handle_spawn.rs`::handle_spawn with attacker-controlled Rosetta construction payloads, transaction identifiers, block ranges, ledger responses, and retry timing to reorder callbacks, gossip artifacts, or timer events to violate exactly-once semantics; specifically, can this undercharge fees or mis-handle refunds when transfer/approval state changes across retries, violating the invariant that ledger balances plus fees must be conserved across transfer, approve, transfer_from, archive, and index paths, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/rosetta-api/icp/src/ledger_client/handle_spawn.rs`::handle_spawn
- Entrypoint: a spender races allowance, transfer_from, fee, memo, timestamp, and duplicate transaction windows
- Attacker controls: Rosetta construction payloads, transaction identifiers, block ranges, ledger responses, and retry timing
- Exploit idea: undercharge fees or mis-handle refunds when transfer/approval state changes across retries
- Invariant to test: ledger balances plus fees must be conserved across transfer, approve, transfer_from, archive, and index paths
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs
