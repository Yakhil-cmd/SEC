# Q0576: Count Sub Keys cosmos tx invariant edge b430

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `CountSubKeys` in `sei-cosmos/x/auth/ante/sigverify.go` via public Cosmos SDK transaction or query handler, controlling public message fields, signatures, fees, gas, pagination, addresses, denoms, and repeated transaction ordering, and bypass module-level validation using public message fields and cause committed state to violate its keeper invariant so that the invariant `module keepers must preserve balances, authorization, sequence, gas, and state invariants for every public transaction path` fails, causing `Critical: Direct loss of user funds of USD $5,000 or more, excluding gas fees and yield`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-cosmos/x/auth/ante/sigverify.go:464` `CountSubKeys`
- Entrypoint: public Cosmos SDK transaction or query handler
- Attacker controls: public message fields, signatures, fees, gas, pagination, addresses, denoms, and repeated transaction ordering
- Exploit idea: bypass module-level validation using public message fields and cause committed state to violate its keeper invariant
- Invariant to test: module keepers must preserve balances, authorization, sequence, gas, and state invariants for every public transaction path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: Direct loss of user funds of USD $5,000 or more, excluding gas fees and yield
- Fast validation: Create a module keeper/msg-server regression test using only public messages, then assert the target invariant before and after success, failure, replay, and batching.
