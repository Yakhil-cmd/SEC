# Q1246: ledger: handle set dissolve timestamp rollback edge case

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an exchange/client sends Rosetta API requests with crafted operations, blocks, metadata, or signatures and drive `rs/rosetta-api/icp/src/ledger_client/handle_set_dissolve_timestamp.rs`::handle_set_dissolve_timestamp with attacker-controlled ICRC metadata, allowance expirations, archive callbacks, index sync heights, and duplicate detection fields to force an error path after partial mutation and verify the state transition rolls back completely; specifically, can this undercharge fees or mis-handle refunds when transfer/approval state changes across retries, violating the invariant that archive and index views must not create spendable balance or hide finalized debits, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/rosetta-api/icp/src/ledger_client/handle_set_dissolve_timestamp.rs`::handle_set_dissolve_timestamp
- Entrypoint: an exchange/client sends Rosetta API requests with crafted operations, blocks, metadata, or signatures
- Attacker controls: ICRC metadata, allowance expirations, archive callbacks, index sync heights, and duplicate detection fields
- Exploit idea: undercharge fees or mis-handle refunds when transfer/approval state changes across retries
- Invariant to test: archive and index views must not create spendable balance or hide finalized debits
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs
