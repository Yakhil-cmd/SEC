# Q1281: ledger: is transfer authorization boundary

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through public transfer or transfer_from flow and drive `rs/rosetta-api/icp/src/transaction_id.rs`::is_transfer with attacker-controlled Rosetta construction payloads, transaction identifiers, block ranges, ledger responses, and retry timing to bypass authorization by desynchronizing caller identity, effective canister/account, and validated state; specifically, can this bypass duplicate detection or allowance decrementing by racing replayed but differently encoded requests, violating the invariant that duplicate/replay windows must reject repeated value movement under all encodings, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/rosetta-api/icp/src/transaction_id.rs`::is_transfer
- Entrypoint: public transfer or transfer_from flow
- Attacker controls: Rosetta construction payloads, transaction identifiers, block ranges, ledger responses, and retry timing
- Exploit idea: bypass duplicate detection or allowance decrementing by racing replayed but differently encoded requests
- Invariant to test: duplicate/replay windows must reject repeated value movement under all encodings
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs
