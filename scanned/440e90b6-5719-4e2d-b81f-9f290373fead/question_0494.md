# Q494: crypto: sign threshold resource accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through public signature or threshold-signing request path and drive `rs/crypto/src/sign/threshold_sig.rs`::sign_threshold with attacker-controlled transcripts, dealings, complaints, openings, signature shares, derivation paths, and message bytes to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this make verification accept a share/transcript under the wrong domain, registry version, or signer set, violating the invariant that node/canister/TLS key validation must not accept keys outside the registered identity context, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/crypto/src/sign/threshold_sig.rs`::sign_threshold
- Entrypoint: public signature or threshold-signing request path
- Attacker controls: transcripts, dealings, complaints, openings, signature shares, derivation paths, and message bytes
- Exploit idea: make verification accept a share/transcript under the wrong domain, registry version, or signer set
- Invariant to test: node/canister/TLS key validation must not accept keys outside the registered identity context
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass
- Fast validation: fuzz encodings/transcripts/signature shares and assert verification rejects cross-domain or malformed variants
