# Q542: chain fusion: sign transaction replay/idempotency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through public signature or threshold-signing request path and drive `rs/dogecoin/ckdoge/minter/src/transaction/mod.rs`::sign_transaction with attacker-controlled minter state transitions, retry ordering, chain-key signature requests, and external-chain transaction encodings to replay, repeat, or race an accepted message so the side effect is applied twice or cleanup is skipped; specifically, can this cause minter and ledger state to diverge after a failed withdrawal, reimbursement, or callback retry, violating the invariant that minter operations must be idempotent across retries, reimbursements, and adapter/RPC inconsistencies, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/dogecoin/ckdoge/minter/src/transaction/mod.rs`::sign_transaction
- Entrypoint: public signature or threshold-signing request path
- Attacker controls: minter state transitions, retry ordering, chain-key signature requests, and external-chain transaction encodings
- Exploit idea: cause minter and ledger state to diverge after a failed withdrawal, reimbursement, or callback retry
- Invariant to test: minter operations must be idempotent across retries, reimbursements, and adapter/RPC inconsistencies
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency; repeat the same request before and after callback/timer boundaries and assert exactly-once effects
