# Q2696: chain fusion: validate address rollback edge case

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through publicly reachable validation path and drive `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/updates/icrc21.rs`::validate_address with attacker-controlled minter state transitions, retry ordering, chain-key signature requests, and external-chain transaction encodings to force an error path after partial mutation and verify the state transition rolls back completely; specifically, can this replay or reorder external-chain observations to mint ck tokens twice or skip burn-on-withdrawal accounting, violating the invariant that threshold signing must only authorize transactions derived from valid minter state, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/updates/icrc21.rs`::validate_address
- Entrypoint: publicly reachable validation path
- Attacker controls: minter state transitions, retry ordering, chain-key signature requests, and external-chain transaction encodings
- Exploit idea: replay or reorder external-chain observations to mint ck tokens twice or skip burn-on-withdrawal accounting
- Invariant to test: threshold signing must only authorize transactions derived from valid minter state
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency
