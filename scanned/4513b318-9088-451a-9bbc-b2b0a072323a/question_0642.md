# Q642: execution: evaluate query call graph replay/idempotency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through public query endpoint and drive `rs/execution_environment/src/query_handler/query_call_graph.rs`::evaluate_query_call_graph with attacker-controlled Wasm bytecode, system API arguments, stable-memory offsets, cycles, callbacks, and reject paths to replay, repeat, or race an accepted message so the side effect is applied twice or cleanup is skipped; specifically, can this cause query and replicated execution to disagree about certified or observable state, violating the invariant that instruction, memory, and cycles accounting must remain conserved across retries and callbacks, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/execution_environment/src/query_handler/query_call_graph.rs`::evaluate_query_call_graph
- Entrypoint: public query endpoint
- Attacker controls: Wasm bytecode, system API arguments, stable-memory offsets, cycles, callbacks, and reject paths
- Exploit idea: cause query and replicated execution to disagree about certified or observable state
- Invariant to test: instruction, memory, and cycles accounting must remain conserved across retries and callbacks
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement
- Fast validation: run a state-machine test with crafted Wasm and assert state, cycles, callbacks, and certified data after trap/retry paths; repeat the same request before and after callback/timer boundaries and assert exactly-once effects
