# Q248: state certification: lib bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an ingress/canister flow mutates certified variables then requests witness generation and drive `rs/canonical_state/tree_hash/src/lib.rs`::lib with attacker-controlled checkpoint heights, stream slices, state metadata, hash-tree labels, and certified-data keys to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this produce a witness that omits or aliases a security-critical subtree used by clients, violating the invariant that read_state witnesses must not prove stale, missing, or forged subnet/canister state, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: forged certified state, invalid state installation, or replicated-state integrity loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/canonical_state/tree_hash/src/lib.rs`::lib
- Entrypoint: an ingress/canister flow mutates certified variables then requests witness generation
- Attacker controls: checkpoint heights, stream slices, state metadata, hash-tree labels, and certified-data keys
- Exploit idea: produce a witness that omits or aliases a security-critical subtree used by clients
- Invariant to test: read_state witnesses must not prove stale, missing, or forged subnet/canister state
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: forged certified state, invalid state installation, or replicated-state integrity loss
- Fast validation: build a manifest/witness differential test with malformed chunks or labels and assert hash/certification rejection; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
