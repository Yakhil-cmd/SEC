# Q990: registry or orchestrator: get version signature/domain

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a node/operator registration flow supplies keys, endpoints, rewards data, or registry records and drive `rs/orchestrator/src/process_manager.rs`::get_version with attacker-controlled node public keys, TLS certs, endpoints, proposal payloads, upgrade metadata, and registry deltas to reuse signatures, transcripts, or request IDs across domains, algorithms, or registry versions; specifically, can this double-apply or skip a rewards/configuration transition due to malformed registry-derived state, violating the invariant that orchestrator behavior must be deterministic for a given certified registry version, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: consensus configuration compromise, unauthorized node/governance effect, or significant infrastructure integrity loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/orchestrator/src/process_manager.rs`::get_version
- Entrypoint: a node/operator registration flow supplies keys, endpoints, rewards data, or registry records
- Attacker controls: node public keys, TLS certs, endpoints, proposal payloads, upgrade metadata, and registry deltas
- Exploit idea: double-apply or skip a rewards/configuration transition due to malformed registry-derived state
- Invariant to test: orchestrator behavior must be deterministic for a given certified registry version
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: consensus configuration compromise, unauthorized node/governance effect, or significant infrastructure integrity loss
- Fast validation: construct registry mutation/orchestrator-consumer tests and assert invariant validation rejects malformed records; mutate domain separators, registry versions, signer IDs, and message bytes independently
