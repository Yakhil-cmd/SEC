# Q2552: Get Validator By Cons Addr staking invariant edge c716

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `GetValidatorByConsAddr` in `sei-cosmos/x/staking/keeper/validator.go` via public staking, delegation, undelegation, redelegation, evidence, or slashing message flow, controlling delegator/validator addresses, shares, denom amounts, redelegation targets, unbonding timing, evidence payloads, and message ordering, and make validator set updates diverge from staking keeper state during public end-block or message flows so that the invariant `delegator shares, validator tokens, power updates, unbonding queues, and slashing state must remain conserved and deterministic` fails, causing `Critical: Permanent freezing of user funds of USD $5,000 or more`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-cosmos/x/staking/keeper/validator.go:37` `GetValidatorByConsAddr`
- Entrypoint: public staking, delegation, undelegation, redelegation, evidence, or slashing message flow
- Attacker controls: delegator/validator addresses, shares, denom amounts, redelegation targets, unbonding timing, evidence payloads, and message ordering
- Exploit idea: make validator set updates diverge from staking keeper state during public end-block or message flows
- Invariant to test: delegator shares, validator tokens, power updates, unbonding queues, and slashing state must remain conserved and deterministic
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: Permanent freezing of user funds of USD $5,000 or more
- Fast validation: Create a state-machine test around delegation/redelegation/unbonding/evidence ordering and assert shares, tokens, power, slashing, and unbonding queues stay consistent.
