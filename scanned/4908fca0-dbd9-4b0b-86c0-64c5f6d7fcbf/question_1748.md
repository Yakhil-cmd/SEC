# Q1748: ledger: as array bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a caller queries archive/index state while ledger blocks are being appended or synchronized and drive `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc/generic_value.rs`::as_array with attacker-controlled accounts, subaccounts, spender, amount, fee, memo, created_at_time, block index, operation order, and signatures to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this confuse account/subaccount encoding so authorization or accounting applies to the wrong account, violating the invariant that Rosetta construction/parse/submit must map one signed transaction to one ledger effect, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc/generic_value.rs`::as_array
- Entrypoint: a caller queries archive/index state while ledger blocks are being appended or synchronized
- Attacker controls: accounts, subaccounts, spender, amount, fee, memo, created_at_time, block index, operation order, and signatures
- Exploit idea: confuse account/subaccount encoding so authorization or accounting applies to the wrong account
- Invariant to test: Rosetta construction/parse/submit must map one signed transaction to one ledger effect
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
