# Q1923: consensus: apply canonical encoding

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a below-threshold protocol peer replays notarization/finalization/CUP artifacts and drive `rs/artifact_pool/src/canister_http_pool.rs`::apply with attacker-controlled ingress batches, payload limits, expiry windows, and repeated admissible messages to use alternative encodings or unknown fields so validation and execution interpret different values; specifically, can this make validation accept an artifact whose dependencies or height context differ across honest replicas, violating the invariant that payload validation must bind ingress, xnet, canister HTTP, and chain-key sections to the same context, and produce HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/artifact_pool/src/canister_http_pool.rs`::apply
- Entrypoint: a below-threshold protocol peer replays notarization/finalization/CUP artifacts
- Attacker controls: ingress batches, payload limits, expiry windows, and repeated admissible messages
- Exploit idea: make validation accept an artifact whose dependencies or height context differ across honest replicas
- Invariant to test: payload validation must bind ingress, xnet, canister HTTP, and chain-key sections to the same context
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization
- Fast validation: construct a local consensus/pool test with two artifact arrival orders and assert identical validation/finalization results; add differential encode/decode cases for unknown fields, alternate lengths, and canonical hashes
