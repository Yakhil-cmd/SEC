# Q3266: execution: Demux Server rollback edge case

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an ingress sender installs or upgrades a crafted Wasm module through management-canister flows and drive `rs/canister_sandbox/src/controller_launcher_service.rs`::DemuxServer with attacker-controlled Wasm bytecode, system API arguments, stable-memory offsets, cycles, callbacks, and reject paths to force an error path after partial mutation and verify the state transition rolls back completely; specifically, can this cause query and replicated execution to disagree about certified or observable state, violating the invariant that instruction, memory, and cycles accounting must remain conserved across retries and callbacks, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/canister_sandbox/src/controller_launcher_service.rs`::DemuxServer
- Entrypoint: an ingress sender installs or upgrades a crafted Wasm module through management-canister flows
- Attacker controls: Wasm bytecode, system API arguments, stable-memory offsets, cycles, callbacks, and reject paths
- Exploit idea: cause query and replicated execution to disagree about certified or observable state
- Invariant to test: instruction, memory, and cycles accounting must remain conserved across retries and callbacks
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement
- Fast validation: run a state-machine test with crafted Wasm and assert state, cycles, callbacks, and certified data after trap/retry paths
