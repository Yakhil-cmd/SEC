# Q3158: boundary: Config Getter bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a web client supplies hostnames, effective canister IDs, request IDs, certified asset paths, and ingress messages and drive `rs/boundary_node/rate_limits/canister/getter.rs`::ConfigGetter with attacker-controlled hostnames, raw/certified asset routing, rate-limit keys, read_state paths, cache state, and retry timing to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this route a request to a different effective canister/subnet than the one validated or certified, violating the invariant that read_state/query/certified asset responses must not be forgeable or stale beyond protocol rules, and produce HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/boundary_node/rate_limits/canister/getter.rs`::ConfigGetter
- Entrypoint: a web client supplies hostnames, effective canister IDs, request IDs, certified asset paths, and ingress messages
- Attacker controls: hostnames, raw/certified asset routing, rate-limit keys, read_state paths, cache state, and retry timing
- Exploit idea: route a request to a different effective canister/subnet than the one validated or certified
- Invariant to test: read_state/query/certified asset responses must not be forgeable or stale beyond protocol rules
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash
- Fast validation: send crafted HTTP/API requests in a local boundary/replica setup and compare validation, routing, and certification outputs; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
