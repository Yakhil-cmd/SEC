# Q2424: chain fusion: Ck Btc Minter Agent resource accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a protocol peer or adapter client supplies chain-fusion payloads that enter consensus or minter state and drive `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/agent/src/lib.rs`::CkBtcMinterAgent with attacker-controlled deposit addresses, UTXO sets, withdrawal amounts, destination addresses, ERC20 logs, block heights, and RPC payloads to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this replay or reorder external-chain observations to mint ck tokens twice or skip burn-on-withdrawal accounting, violating the invariant that threshold signing must only authorize transactions derived from valid minter state, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/agent/src/lib.rs`::CkBtcMinterAgent
- Entrypoint: a protocol peer or adapter client supplies chain-fusion payloads that enter consensus or minter state
- Attacker controls: deposit addresses, UTXO sets, withdrawal amounts, destination addresses, ERC20 logs, block heights, and RPC payloads
- Exploit idea: replay or reorder external-chain observations to mint ck tokens twice or skip burn-on-withdrawal accounting
- Invariant to test: threshold signing must only authorize transactions derived from valid minter state
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency
