# Q3135: Delete ERC20 CW20 Pointer evm core invariant edge 606e

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `DeleteERC20CW20Pointer` in `x/evm/keeper/pointer.go` via public EVM transaction through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, or DeliverTx, controlling EVM tx type, chain id, nonce, gas caps, access list, calldata, value, authorization list, and account association state, and bypass ante, fee, nonce, chain-id, association, or stateless validation so execution consumes resources or mutates state incorrectly so that the invariant `EVM ante, execution, receipts, nonce, balances, gas purchase/refund, and Cosmos state commits must be mutually consistent` fails, causing `Critical: Permanent freezing of user funds of USD $5,000 or more`?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/pointer.go:90` `DeleteERC20CW20Pointer`
- Entrypoint: public EVM transaction through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, or DeliverTx
- Attacker controls: EVM tx type, chain id, nonce, gas caps, access list, calldata, value, authorization list, and account association state
- Exploit idea: bypass ante, fee, nonce, chain-id, association, or stateless validation so execution consumes resources or mutates state incorrectly
- Invariant to test: EVM ante, execution, receipts, nonce, balances, gas purchase/refund, and Cosmos state commits must be mutually consistent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: Permanent freezing of user funds of USD $5,000 or more
- Fast validation: Run the tx through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, DeliverTx, and receipt query paths, then diff nonce, balance, gas, logs, receipts, and committed state.
