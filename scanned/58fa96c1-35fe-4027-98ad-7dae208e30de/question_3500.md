# Q3500: execution: start execution signature/domain

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a caller submits ingress that drives canister lifecycle, cycle transfer, and stable-memory paths and drive `rs/canister_sandbox/src/sandbox_server.rs`::start_execution with attacker-controlled install/upgrade payloads, canister settings, controllers, memory pages, and execution round timing to reuse signatures, transcripts, or request IDs across domains, algorithms, or registry versions; specifically, can this make pre-trap accounting diverge from post-rollback state for cycles, memory, callbacks, or refunds, violating the invariant that canister execution must be deterministic and rollback all state/cycles effects after traps, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/canister_sandbox/src/sandbox_server.rs`::start_execution
- Entrypoint: a caller submits ingress that drives canister lifecycle, cycle transfer, and stable-memory paths
- Attacker controls: install/upgrade payloads, canister settings, controllers, memory pages, and execution round timing
- Exploit idea: make pre-trap accounting diverge from post-rollback state for cycles, memory, callbacks, or refunds
- Invariant to test: canister execution must be deterministic and rollback all state/cycles effects after traps
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement
- Fast validation: run a state-machine test with crafted Wasm and assert state, cycles, callbacks, and certified data after trap/retry paths; mutate domain separators, registry versions, signer IDs, and message bytes independently
