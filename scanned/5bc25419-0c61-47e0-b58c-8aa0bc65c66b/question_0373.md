# Q373: crypto: Csp Fs Encryption Secret Key canonical encoding

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a canister requests threshold ECDSA/Schnorr/vetKD signatures through public management APIs and drive `rs/crypto/internal/crypto_lib/threshold_sig/bls12_381/src/ni_dkg/types.rs`::CspFsEncryptionSecretKey with attacker-controlled transcripts, dealings, complaints, openings, signature shares, derivation paths, and message bytes to use alternative encodings or unknown fields so validation and execution interpret different values; specifically, can this trigger parser ambiguity so two encodings verify as the same key or message in different layers, violating the invariant that threshold protocols must not leak key shares or sign unauthorized messages below threshold compromise, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/crypto/internal/crypto_lib/threshold_sig/bls12_381/src/ni_dkg/types.rs`::CspFsEncryptionSecretKey
- Entrypoint: a canister requests threshold ECDSA/Schnorr/vetKD signatures through public management APIs
- Attacker controls: transcripts, dealings, complaints, openings, signature shares, derivation paths, and message bytes
- Exploit idea: trigger parser ambiguity so two encodings verify as the same key or message in different layers
- Invariant to test: threshold protocols must not leak key shares or sign unauthorized messages below threshold compromise
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass
- Fast validation: fuzz encodings/transcripts/signature shares and assert verification rejects cross-domain or malformed variants; add differential encode/decode cases for unknown fields, alternate lengths, and canonical hashes
