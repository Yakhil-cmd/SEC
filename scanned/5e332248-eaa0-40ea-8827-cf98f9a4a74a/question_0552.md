# Q552: execution: main memory type replay/idempotency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a caller submits ingress that drives canister lifecycle, cycle transfer, and stable-memory paths and drive `rs/embedders/src/wasm_utils/instrumentation.rs`::main_memory_type with attacker-controlled Wasm bytecode, system API arguments, stable-memory offsets, cycles, callbacks, and reject paths to replay, repeat, or race an accepted message so the side effect is applied twice or cleanup is skipped; specifically, can this exploit a DTS pause/resume boundary to reuse stale execution state or duplicate a response, violating the invariant that canister execution must be deterministic and rollback all state/cycles effects after traps, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/embedders/src/wasm_utils/instrumentation.rs`::main_memory_type
- Entrypoint: a caller submits ingress that drives canister lifecycle, cycle transfer, and stable-memory paths
- Attacker controls: Wasm bytecode, system API arguments, stable-memory offsets, cycles, callbacks, and reject paths
- Exploit idea: exploit a DTS pause/resume boundary to reuse stale execution state or duplicate a response
- Invariant to test: canister execution must be deterministic and rollback all state/cycles effects after traps
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement
- Fast validation: run a state-machine test with crafted Wasm and assert state, cycles, callbacks, and certified data after trap/retry paths; repeat the same request before and after callback/timer boundaries and assert exactly-once effects
