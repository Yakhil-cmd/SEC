# Q2510: chain fusion: check anonymous caller signature/domain

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through public call/ingress endpoint and drive `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/main.rs`::check_anonymous_caller with attacker-controlled minter state transitions, retry ordering, chain-key signature requests, and external-chain transaction encodings to reuse signatures, transcripts, or request IDs across domains, algorithms, or registry versions; specifically, can this replay or reorder external-chain observations to mint ck tokens twice or skip burn-on-withdrawal accounting, violating the invariant that minter operations must be idempotent across retries, reimbursements, and adapter/RPC inconsistencies, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/main.rs`::check_anonymous_caller
- Entrypoint: public call/ingress endpoint
- Attacker controls: minter state transitions, retry ordering, chain-key signature requests, and external-chain transaction encodings
- Exploit idea: replay or reorder external-chain observations to mint ck tokens twice or skip burn-on-withdrawal accounting
- Invariant to test: minter operations must be idempotent across retries, reimbursements, and adapter/RPC inconsistencies
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency; mutate domain separators, registry versions, signer IDs, and message bytes independently
