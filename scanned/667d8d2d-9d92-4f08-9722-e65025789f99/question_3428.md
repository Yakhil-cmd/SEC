# Q3428: execution: evict some due to rss bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a caller submits ingress that drives canister lifecycle, cycle transfer, and stable-memory paths and drive `rs/canister_sandbox/src/replica_controller/sandbox_process_eviction.rs`::evict_some_due_to_rss with attacker-controlled install/upgrade payloads, canister settings, controllers, memory pages, and execution round timing to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this exploit a DTS pause/resume boundary to reuse stale execution state or duplicate a response, violating the invariant that canister execution must be deterministic and rollback all state/cycles effects after traps, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/canister_sandbox/src/replica_controller/sandbox_process_eviction.rs`::evict_some_due_to_rss
- Entrypoint: a caller submits ingress that drives canister lifecycle, cycle transfer, and stable-memory paths
- Attacker controls: install/upgrade payloads, canister settings, controllers, memory pages, and execution round timing
- Exploit idea: exploit a DTS pause/resume boundary to reuse stale execution state or duplicate a response
- Invariant to test: canister execution must be deterministic and rollback all state/cycles effects after traps
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement
- Fast validation: run a state-machine test with crafted Wasm and assert state, cycles, callbacks, and certified data after trap/retry paths; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
