# Q918: nns governance: execute bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a governance participant repeats or races neuron-management calls through Rosetta/NNS canister APIs and drive `rs/nns/governance/src/timer_tasks/seeding.rs`::execute with attacker-controlled caller principal, neuron ID/subaccount, proposal action, memo, amount, dissolve delay, vote, and timestamps to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this double-apply a proposal/neuron state transition through retry, timer, or inter-canister callback ordering, violating the invariant that voting power, maturity, rewards, and neuron ownership must not be forgeable or double-counted, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: unauthorized NNS governance/neuron access or theft/illegal minting of ICP/Cycles/assets?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/nns/governance/src/timer_tasks/seeding.rs`::execute
- Entrypoint: a governance participant repeats or races neuron-management calls through Rosetta/NNS canister APIs
- Attacker controls: caller principal, neuron ID/subaccount, proposal action, memo, amount, dissolve delay, vote, and timestamps
- Exploit idea: double-apply a proposal/neuron state transition through retry, timer, or inter-canister callback ordering
- Invariant to test: voting power, maturity, rewards, and neuron ownership must not be forgeable or double-counted
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: unauthorized NNS governance/neuron access or theft/illegal minting of ICP/Cycles/assets
- Fast validation: write a PocketIC/state-machine test that races the public governance call and asserts permissions/accounting/exactly-once execution; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
