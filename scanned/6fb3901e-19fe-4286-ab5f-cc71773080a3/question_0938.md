# Q0938: Route tokenfactory invariant edge 1ddd

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Route` in `x/tokenfactory/types/msgs.go` via public tokenfactory message submitted by an account or contract binding, controlling denom names, metadata, mint/burn amounts, authority-controlled fields exposed to users, hooks, and wasm bindings, and make one accepted denom representation resolve to a different bank denom in a later module path so that the invariant `tokenfactory authority, bank supply, balances, metadata, and denom ownership must remain consistent after every public flow` fails, causing `Critical: Direct loss of user funds of USD $5,000 or more, excluding gas fees and yield`?

## Target
- File/function: `x/tokenfactory/types/msgs.go:100` `Route`
- Entrypoint: public tokenfactory message submitted by an account or contract binding
- Attacker controls: denom names, metadata, mint/burn amounts, authority-controlled fields exposed to users, hooks, and wasm bindings
- Exploit idea: make one accepted denom representation resolve to a different bank denom in a later module path
- Invariant to test: tokenfactory authority, bank supply, balances, metadata, and denom ownership must remain consistent after every public flow
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: Direct loss of user funds of USD $5,000 or more, excluding gas fees and yield
- Fast validation: Use keeper/msg-server tests with attacker-owned accounts and denoms, then assert authority, bank supply, balances, and metadata before and after the edge sequence.
