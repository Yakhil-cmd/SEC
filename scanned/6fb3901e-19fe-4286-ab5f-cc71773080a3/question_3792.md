# Q3792: Index Tx Events consensus invariant edge 1d88

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `IndexTxEvents` in `sei-tendermint/internal/state/indexer/sink/null/null.go` via publicly submitted transaction or peer-delivered block/proposal data processed by validators, controlling transaction payloads, proposer-included ordering, block data size, evidence payloads, and peer-visible proposal inputs, and exploit encoding, evidence, or block metadata edge cases to panic or reject valid blocks on default validators so that the invariant `all honest validators must deterministically derive the same app state and block validity from the same proposal` fails, causing `High: Network not being able to confirm new transactions from total shutdown or consensus failure`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-tendermint/internal/state/indexer/sink/null/null.go:29` `IndexTxEvents`
- Entrypoint: publicly submitted transaction or peer-delivered block/proposal data processed by validators
- Attacker controls: transaction payloads, proposer-included ordering, block data size, evidence payloads, and peer-visible proposal inputs
- Exploit idea: exploit encoding, evidence, or block metadata edge cases to panic or reject valid blocks on default validators
- Invariant to test: all honest validators must deterministically derive the same app state and block validity from the same proposal
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: Network not being able to confirm new transactions from total shutdown or consensus failure
- Fast validation: Run a two-validator localnet or deterministic state test, feed the crafted tx/proposal/evidence, and compare app hash, block result, panic behavior, and processing time.
