# Q2482: chain fusion: estimate fee per vbyte replay/idempotency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a canister requests Bitcoin/Ethereum/Dogecoin integration data through public management or adapter paths and drive `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/lib.rs`::estimate_fee_per_vbyte with attacker-controlled memos, reimbursement IDs, transaction status, fee estimates, finality depth, adapter responses, and ledger callbacks to replay, repeat, or race an accepted message so the side effect is applied twice or cleanup is skipped; specifically, can this obtain a chain-key signature for a transaction not authorized by the finalized minter state, violating the invariant that minter operations must be idempotent across retries, reimbursements, and adapter/RPC inconsistencies, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/lib.rs`::estimate_fee_per_vbyte
- Entrypoint: a canister requests Bitcoin/Ethereum/Dogecoin integration data through public management or adapter paths
- Attacker controls: memos, reimbursement IDs, transaction status, fee estimates, finality depth, adapter responses, and ledger callbacks
- Exploit idea: obtain a chain-key signature for a transaction not authorized by the finalized minter state
- Invariant to test: minter operations must be idempotent across retries, reimbursements, and adapter/RPC inconsistencies
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency; repeat the same request before and after callback/timer boundaries and assert exactly-once effects
