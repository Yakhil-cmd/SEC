# Q2653: chain fusion: build estimate retrieve btc fee 1 50k sats canonical encoding

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through public retrieve/withdraw/update-balance flow and drive `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/storage.rs`::build_estimate_retrieve_btc_fee_1_50k_sats with attacker-controlled deposit addresses, UTXO sets, withdrawal amounts, destination addresses, ERC20 logs, block heights, and RPC payloads to use alternative encodings or unknown fields so validation and execution interpret different values; specifically, can this accept an external-chain log/UTXO/transaction under the wrong finality, address, token, or chain context, violating the invariant that ck-token supply must be conserved against finalized external-chain deposits and withdrawals, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/storage.rs`::build_estimate_retrieve_btc_fee_1_50k_sats
- Entrypoint: public retrieve/withdraw/update-balance flow
- Attacker controls: deposit addresses, UTXO sets, withdrawal amounts, destination addresses, ERC20 logs, block heights, and RPC payloads
- Exploit idea: accept an external-chain log/UTXO/transaction under the wrong finality, address, token, or chain context
- Invariant to test: ck-token supply must be conserved against finalized external-chain deposits and withdrawals
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency; add differential encode/decode cases for unknown fields, alternate lengths, and canonical hashes
