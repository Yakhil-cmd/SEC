# Q314: crypto: lib resource accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a protocol peer submits malformed DKG/IDKG dealings, complaints, openings, or signature shares and drive `rs/crypto/iccsa/src/lib.rs`::lib with attacker-controlled DER/COSE/protobuf encodings, curve points, public keys, domain separators, and registry key records to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this bypass subgroup, canonical encoding, or domain-separation checks for a threshold-signature operation, violating the invariant that node/canister/TLS key validation must not accept keys outside the registered identity context, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/crypto/iccsa/src/lib.rs`::lib
- Entrypoint: a protocol peer submits malformed DKG/IDKG dealings, complaints, openings, or signature shares
- Attacker controls: DER/COSE/protobuf encodings, curve points, public keys, domain separators, and registry key records
- Exploit idea: bypass subgroup, canonical encoding, or domain-separation checks for a threshold-signature operation
- Invariant to test: node/canister/TLS key validation must not accept keys outside the registered identity context
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass
- Fast validation: fuzz encodings/transcripts/signature shares and assert verification rejects cross-domain or malformed variants
