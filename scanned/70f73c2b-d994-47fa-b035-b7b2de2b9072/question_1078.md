# Q1078: registry or orchestrator: do remove nodes from subnet bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a node/operator registration flow supplies keys, endpoints, rewards data, or registry records and drive `rs/registry/canister/src/mutations/do_remove_nodes_from_subnet.rs`::do_remove_nodes_from_subnet with attacker-controlled registry mutation payloads, node records, subnet membership, routing tables, replica versions, rewards data, and timestamps to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this bypass node-key or endpoint validation to inject a record that affects consensus/boundary behavior, violating the invariant that orchestrator behavior must be deterministic for a given certified registry version, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: consensus configuration compromise, unauthorized node/governance effect, or significant infrastructure integrity loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/registry/canister/src/mutations/do_remove_nodes_from_subnet.rs`::do_remove_nodes_from_subnet
- Entrypoint: a node/operator registration flow supplies keys, endpoints, rewards data, or registry records
- Attacker controls: registry mutation payloads, node records, subnet membership, routing tables, replica versions, rewards data, and timestamps
- Exploit idea: bypass node-key or endpoint validation to inject a record that affects consensus/boundary behavior
- Invariant to test: orchestrator behavior must be deterministic for a given certified registry version
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: consensus configuration compromise, unauthorized node/governance effect, or significant infrastructure integrity loss
- Fast validation: construct registry mutation/orchestrator-consumer tests and assert invariant validation rejects malformed records; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
