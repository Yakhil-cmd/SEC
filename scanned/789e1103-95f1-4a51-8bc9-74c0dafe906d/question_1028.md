# Q1028: consensus: mod bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a canister HTTP participant supplies divergent responses that enter consensus payload building and drive `rs/p2p/state_sync_manager/src/routes/mod.rs`::mod with attacker-controlled ingress batches, payload limits, expiry windows, and repeated admissible messages to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this race purge/admission logic so a stale but well-formed artifact influences finalization, violating the invariant that honest replicas must not finalize or notarize a block that fails deterministic validation, and produce HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/p2p/state_sync_manager/src/routes/mod.rs`::mod
- Entrypoint: a canister HTTP participant supplies divergent responses that enter consensus payload building
- Attacker controls: ingress batches, payload limits, expiry windows, and repeated admissible messages
- Exploit idea: race purge/admission logic so a stale but well-formed artifact influences finalization
- Invariant to test: honest replicas must not finalize or notarize a block that fails deterministic validation
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization
- Fast validation: construct a local consensus/pool test with two artifact arrival orders and assert identical validation/finalization results; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
