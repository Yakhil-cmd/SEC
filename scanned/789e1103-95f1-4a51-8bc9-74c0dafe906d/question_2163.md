# Q2163: chain fusion: validate services canonical encoding

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through publicly reachable validation path and drive `rs/bitcoin/adapter/src/addressbook.rs`::validate_services with attacker-controlled memos, reimbursement IDs, transaction status, fee estimates, finality depth, adapter responses, and ledger callbacks to use alternative encodings or unknown fields so validation and execution interpret different values; specifically, can this obtain a chain-key signature for a transaction not authorized by the finalized minter state, violating the invariant that external-chain evidence must be bound to chain, token, address, finality, and ledger account context, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/adapter/src/addressbook.rs`::validate_services
- Entrypoint: publicly reachable validation path
- Attacker controls: memos, reimbursement IDs, transaction status, fee estimates, finality depth, adapter responses, and ledger callbacks
- Exploit idea: obtain a chain-key signature for a transaction not authorized by the finalized minter state
- Invariant to test: external-chain evidence must be bound to chain, token, address, finality, and ledger account context
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency; add differential encode/decode cases for unknown fields, alternate lengths, and canonical hashes
