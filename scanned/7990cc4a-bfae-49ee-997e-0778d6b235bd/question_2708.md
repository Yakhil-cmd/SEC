# Q2708: chain fusion: Retrieve Btc Ok bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through public retrieve/withdraw/update-balance flow and drive `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/updates/retrieve_btc.rs`::RetrieveBtcOk with attacker-controlled minter state transitions, retry ordering, chain-key signature requests, and external-chain transaction encodings to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this accept an external-chain log/UTXO/transaction under the wrong finality, address, token, or chain context, violating the invariant that threshold signing must only authorize transactions derived from valid minter state, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/updates/retrieve_btc.rs`::RetrieveBtcOk
- Entrypoint: public retrieve/withdraw/update-balance flow
- Attacker controls: minter state transitions, retry ordering, chain-key signature requests, and external-chain transaction encodings
- Exploit idea: accept an external-chain log/UTXO/transaction under the wrong finality, address, token, or chain context
- Invariant to test: threshold signing must only authorize transactions derived from valid minter state
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
