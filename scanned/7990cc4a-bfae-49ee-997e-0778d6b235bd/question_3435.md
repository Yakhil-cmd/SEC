# Q3435: execution: evic due to rss based on scheduler priorities and last used cross module mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a canister creates nested callbacks, rejects, replies, and DTS pauses that reach execution scheduling and drive `rs/canister_sandbox/src/replica_controller/sandbox_process_eviction.rs`::evic_due_to_rss_based_on_scheduler_priorities_and_last_used with attacker-controlled install/upgrade payloads, canister settings, controllers, memory pages, and execution round timing to make producer and consumer modules disagree on height, registry version, state hash, or authorization context; specifically, can this make pre-trap accounting diverge from post-rollback state for cycles, memory, callbacks, or refunds, violating the invariant that canister lifecycle operations must not bypass controller/effective-canister authorization, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/canister_sandbox/src/replica_controller/sandbox_process_eviction.rs`::evic_due_to_rss_based_on_scheduler_priorities_and_last_used
- Entrypoint: a canister creates nested callbacks, rejects, replies, and DTS pauses that reach execution scheduling
- Attacker controls: install/upgrade payloads, canister settings, controllers, memory pages, and execution round timing
- Exploit idea: make pre-trap accounting diverge from post-rollback state for cycles, memory, callbacks, or refunds
- Invariant to test: canister lifecycle operations must not bypass controller/effective-canister authorization
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement
- Fast validation: run a state-machine test with crafted Wasm and assert state, cycles, callbacks, and certified data after trap/retry paths
