# Q1161: chain fusion: push response authorization boundary

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a ckBTC/ckETH/ckERC20/ckDOGE user submits deposit, withdrawal, update-balance, retrieve, or reimbursement calls and drive `rs/replicated_state/src/bitcoin.rs`::push_response with attacker-controlled deposit addresses, UTXO sets, withdrawal amounts, destination addresses, ERC20 logs, block heights, and RPC payloads to bypass authorization by desynchronizing caller identity, effective canister/account, and validated state; specifically, can this accept an external-chain log/UTXO/transaction under the wrong finality, address, token, or chain context, violating the invariant that ck-token supply must be conserved against finalized external-chain deposits and withdrawals, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/replicated_state/src/bitcoin.rs`::push_response
- Entrypoint: a ckBTC/ckETH/ckERC20/ckDOGE user submits deposit, withdrawal, update-balance, retrieve, or reimbursement calls
- Attacker controls: deposit addresses, UTXO sets, withdrawal amounts, destination addresses, ERC20 logs, block heights, and RPC payloads
- Exploit idea: accept an external-chain log/UTXO/transaction under the wrong finality, address, token, or chain context
- Invariant to test: ck-token supply must be conserved against finalized external-chain deposits and withdrawals
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency
