# Q1805: Emit Update Client Proposal Event ibc invariant edge 5077

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `EmitUpdateClientProposalEvent` in `sei-ibc-go/modules/core/02-client/keeper/events.go` via IBC packet, acknowledgement, timeout, or proof relay submitted through public message handlers, controlling packet data, source/destination channel fields, timeout height/timestamp, acknowledgements, proofs, memo fields, and relayer timing, and cause escrow, voucher supply, or channel accounting to diverge through timeout, acknowledgement, or replay ordering so that the invariant `escrowed funds, voucher supply, denom traces, acknowledgements, and timeout state must remain conserved across all packet flows` fails, causing `Critical: Direct loss of user funds of USD $5,000 or more, excluding gas fees and yield`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-ibc-go/modules/core/02-client/keeper/events.go:62` `EmitUpdateClientProposalEvent`
- Entrypoint: IBC packet, acknowledgement, timeout, or proof relay submitted through public message handlers
- Attacker controls: packet data, source/destination channel fields, timeout height/timestamp, acknowledgements, proofs, memo fields, and relayer timing
- Exploit idea: cause escrow, voucher supply, or channel accounting to diverge through timeout, acknowledgement, or replay ordering
- Invariant to test: escrowed funds, voucher supply, denom traces, acknowledgements, and timeout state must remain conserved across all packet flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: Direct loss of user funds of USD $5,000 or more, excluding gas fees and yield
- Fast validation: Use IBC keeper/channel tests to relay packet, ack, timeout, and replay variants, then assert escrow, voucher supply, commitments, and acknowledgements remain conserved.
