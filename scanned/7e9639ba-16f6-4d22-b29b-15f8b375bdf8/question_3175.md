# Q3175: boundary: get full config cross module mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a caller repeats or races boundary forwarding, validation, retry, cache, and certified-response paths and drive `rs/boundary_node/rate_limits/canister/state.rs`::get_full_config with attacker-controlled HTTP method/path/headers/body, canister ID, subnet ID, request ID, ingress expiry, signatures, and delegations to make producer and consumer modules disagree on height, registry version, state hash, or authorization context; specifically, can this route a request to a different effective canister/subnet than the one validated or certified, violating the invariant that rate limiting and routing must not bypass ingress validation or expose privileged operations, and produce HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/boundary_node/rate_limits/canister/state.rs`::get_full_config
- Entrypoint: a caller repeats or races boundary forwarding, validation, retry, cache, and certified-response paths
- Attacker controls: HTTP method/path/headers/body, canister ID, subnet ID, request ID, ingress expiry, signatures, and delegations
- Exploit idea: route a request to a different effective canister/subnet than the one validated or certified
- Invariant to test: rate limiting and routing must not bypass ingress validation or expose privileged operations
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash
- Fast validation: send crafted HTTP/API requests in a local boundary/replica setup and compare validation, routing, and certification outputs
