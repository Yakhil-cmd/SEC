# Q3665: state certification: max index cross module mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a protocol peer offers malformed state-sync chunks, manifests, or checkpoint metadata and drive `rs/canonical_state/tree_hash/src/hash_tree.rs`::max_index with attacker-controlled checkpoint heights, stream slices, state metadata, hash-tree labels, and certified-data keys to make producer and consumer modules disagree on height, registry version, state hash, or authorization context; specifically, can this accept a state-sync chunk whose content is not bound to the manifest and height being certified, violating the invariant that checkpoint and certification versions must not create cross-version state ambiguity, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: forged certified state, invalid state installation, or replicated-state integrity loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/canonical_state/tree_hash/src/hash_tree.rs`::max_index
- Entrypoint: a protocol peer offers malformed state-sync chunks, manifests, or checkpoint metadata
- Attacker controls: checkpoint heights, stream slices, state metadata, hash-tree labels, and certified-data keys
- Exploit idea: accept a state-sync chunk whose content is not bound to the manifest and height being certified
- Invariant to test: checkpoint and certification versions must not create cross-version state ambiguity
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: forged certified state, invalid state installation, or replicated-state integrity loss
- Fast validation: build a manifest/witness differential test with malformed chunks or labels and assert hash/certification rejection
