# Q3884: consensus: payload metrics inc resource accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a canister HTTP participant supplies divergent responses that enter consensus payload building and drive `rs/consensus/idkg/src/metrics.rs`::payload_metrics_inc with attacker-controlled committee shares, transcript references, block payload metadata, and artifact arrival order to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this trigger inconsistent handling of oversized or duplicated payload sections before notarization, violating the invariant that honest replicas must not finalize or notarize a block that fails deterministic validation, and produce HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/consensus/idkg/src/metrics.rs`::payload_metrics_inc
- Entrypoint: a canister HTTP participant supplies divergent responses that enter consensus payload building
- Attacker controls: committee shares, transcript references, block payload metadata, and artifact arrival order
- Exploit idea: trigger inconsistent handling of oversized or duplicated payload sections before notarization
- Invariant to test: honest replicas must not finalize or notarize a block that fails deterministic validation
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization
- Fast validation: construct a local consensus/pool test with two artifact arrival orders and assert identical validation/finalization results
