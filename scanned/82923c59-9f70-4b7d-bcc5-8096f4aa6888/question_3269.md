# Q3269: execution: dispatch certification/witness

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a malicious canister invokes public system API calls during update/query execution and drive `rs/canister_sandbox/src/controller_service.rs`::dispatch with attacker-controlled Wasm bytecode, system API arguments, stable-memory offsets, cycles, callbacks, and reject paths to request or construct certified data with ambiguous paths, labels, or stale state; specifically, can this exploit a DTS pause/resume boundary to reuse stale execution state or duplicate a response, violating the invariant that system API and sandbox IPC must not allow memory isolation or authorization bypass, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/canister_sandbox/src/controller_service.rs`::dispatch
- Entrypoint: a malicious canister invokes public system API calls during update/query execution
- Attacker controls: Wasm bytecode, system API arguments, stable-memory offsets, cycles, callbacks, and reject paths
- Exploit idea: exploit a DTS pause/resume boundary to reuse stale execution state or duplicate a response
- Invariant to test: system API and sandbox IPC must not allow memory isolation or authorization bypass
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement
- Fast validation: run a state-machine test with crafted Wasm and assert state, cycles, callbacks, and certified data after trap/retry paths
