# Q1508: types packages: Invalid Regex bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a Rosetta/ICRC/management-canister caller supplies edge-case type values that flow into production logic and drive `packages/canlog/src/types/mod.rs`::InvalidRegex with attacker-controlled large integers, malformed lengths, duplicated fields, unknown variants, and cross-format conversions to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this accept a boundary type value that downstream consensus/ledger/governance logic assumes impossible, violating the invariant that numeric/account/principal conversions must not truncate, alias, or bypass authorization/accounting checks, and produce HackenProof High/Medium: authorization bypass, accounting mismatch, signature confusion, or production platform crash?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/canlog/src/types/mod.rs`::InvalidRegex
- Entrypoint: a Rosetta/ICRC/management-canister caller supplies edge-case type values that flow into production logic
- Attacker controls: large integers, malformed lengths, duplicated fields, unknown variants, and cross-format conversions
- Exploit idea: accept a boundary type value that downstream consensus/ledger/governance logic assumes impossible
- Invariant to test: numeric/account/principal conversions must not truncate, alias, or bypass authorization/accounting checks
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Medium: authorization bypass, accounting mismatch, signature confusion, or production platform crash
- Fast validation: fuzz type round trips and differential consumers, then assert canonical equality, rejection, and no overflow/aliasing; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
