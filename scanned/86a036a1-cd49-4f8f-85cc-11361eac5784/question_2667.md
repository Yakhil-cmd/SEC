# Q2667: format Tx Results cosmos tx invariant edge ecab

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `formatTxResults` in `sei-cosmos/x/auth/tx/query.go` via public Cosmos SDK transaction or query handler, controlling public message fields, signatures, fees, gas, pagination, addresses, denoms, and repeated transaction ordering, and bypass module-level validation using public message fields and cause committed state to violate its keeper invariant so that the invariant `public inputs must not make default nodes crash, stall, or commit state that violates module invariants` fails, causing `Medium: Block production delay exceeding 2.5 seconds on realistic validator hardware, caused by crafted transactions or messages`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-cosmos/x/auth/tx/query.go:96` `formatTxResults`
- Entrypoint: public Cosmos SDK transaction or query handler
- Attacker controls: public message fields, signatures, fees, gas, pagination, addresses, denoms, and repeated transaction ordering
- Exploit idea: bypass module-level validation using public message fields and cause committed state to violate its keeper invariant
- Invariant to test: public inputs must not make default nodes crash, stall, or commit state that violates module invariants
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium: Block production delay exceeding 2.5 seconds on realistic validator hardware, caused by crafted transactions or messages
- Fast validation: Create a module keeper/msg-server regression test using only public messages, then assert the target invariant before and after success, failure, replay, and batching.
