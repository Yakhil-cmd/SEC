# Q0461: New Increment Sequence Decorator cosmos tx invariant edge 5b4a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `NewIncrementSequenceDecorator` in `sei-cosmos/x/auth/ante/sigverify.go` via public Cosmos SDK transaction or query handler, controlling public message fields, signatures, fees, gas, pagination, addresses, denoms, and repeated transaction ordering, and trigger deterministic excessive work, panic, or fee undercharging in a default transaction or query path so that the invariant `module keepers must preserve balances, authorization, sequence, gas, and state invariants for every public transaction path` fails, causing `Critical: Direct loss of user funds of USD $5,000 or more, excluding gas fees and yield`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-cosmos/x/auth/ante/sigverify.go:326` `NewIncrementSequenceDecorator`
- Entrypoint: public Cosmos SDK transaction or query handler
- Attacker controls: public message fields, signatures, fees, gas, pagination, addresses, denoms, and repeated transaction ordering
- Exploit idea: trigger deterministic excessive work, panic, or fee undercharging in a default transaction or query path
- Invariant to test: module keepers must preserve balances, authorization, sequence, gas, and state invariants for every public transaction path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: Direct loss of user funds of USD $5,000 or more, excluding gas fees and yield
- Fast validation: Create a module keeper/msg-server regression test using only public messages, then assert the target invariant before and after success, failure, replay, and batching.
