# Q1548: types packages: Reject Code bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a Rosetta/ICRC/management-canister caller supplies edge-case type values that flow into production logic and drive `packages/ic-error-types/src/lib.rs`::RejectCode with attacker-controlled encoded bytes, enum variants, optional fields, principals, account IDs, amounts, timestamps, hashes, and signatures to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this overflow, truncate, or normalize security-critical fields before authorization or accounting checks, violating the invariant that numeric/account/principal conversions must not truncate, alias, or bypass authorization/accounting checks, and produce HackenProof High/Medium: authorization bypass, accounting mismatch, signature confusion, or production platform crash?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/ic-error-types/src/lib.rs`::RejectCode
- Entrypoint: a Rosetta/ICRC/management-canister caller supplies edge-case type values that flow into production logic
- Attacker controls: encoded bytes, enum variants, optional fields, principals, account IDs, amounts, timestamps, hashes, and signatures
- Exploit idea: overflow, truncate, or normalize security-critical fields before authorization or accounting checks
- Invariant to test: numeric/account/principal conversions must not truncate, alias, or bypass authorization/accounting checks
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Medium: authorization bypass, accounting mismatch, signature confusion, or production platform crash
- Fast validation: fuzz type round trips and differential consumers, then assert canonical equality, rejection, and no overflow/aliasing; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
