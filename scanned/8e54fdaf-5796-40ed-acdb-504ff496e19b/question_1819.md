# Q1819: ledger: minimal burn block certification/witness

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a spender races allowance, transfer_from, fee, memo, timestamp, and duplicate transaction windows and drive `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc122/schema.rs`::minimal_burn_block with attacker-controlled accounts, subaccounts, spender, amount, fee, memo, created_at_time, block index, operation order, and signatures to request or construct certified data with ambiguous paths, labels, or stale state; specifically, can this undercharge fees or mis-handle refunds when transfer/approval state changes across retries, violating the invariant that ledger balances plus fees must be conserved across transfer, approve, transfer_from, archive, and index paths, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc122/schema.rs`::minimal_burn_block
- Entrypoint: a spender races allowance, transfer_from, fee, memo, timestamp, and duplicate transaction windows
- Attacker controls: accounts, subaccounts, spender, amount, fee, memo, created_at_time, block index, operation order, and signatures
- Exploit idea: undercharge fees or mis-handle refunds when transfer/approval state changes across retries
- Invariant to test: ledger balances plus fees must be conserved across transfer, approve, transfer_from, archive, and index paths
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs
