# Q2693: chain fusion: icrc21 canister call consent message canonical encoding

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through public call/ingress endpoint and drive `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/updates/icrc21.rs`::icrc21_canister_call_consent_message with attacker-controlled memos, reimbursement IDs, transaction status, fee estimates, finality depth, adapter responses, and ledger callbacks to use alternative encodings or unknown fields so validation and execution interpret different values; specifically, can this cause minter and ledger state to diverge after a failed withdrawal, reimbursement, or callback retry, violating the invariant that ck-token supply must be conserved against finalized external-chain deposits and withdrawals, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/updates/icrc21.rs`::icrc21_canister_call_consent_message
- Entrypoint: public call/ingress endpoint
- Attacker controls: memos, reimbursement IDs, transaction status, fee estimates, finality depth, adapter responses, and ledger callbacks
- Exploit idea: cause minter and ledger state to diverge after a failed withdrawal, reimbursement, or callback retry
- Invariant to test: ck-token supply must be conserved against finalized external-chain deposits and withdrawals
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency; add differential encode/decode cases for unknown fields, alternate lengths, and canonical hashes
