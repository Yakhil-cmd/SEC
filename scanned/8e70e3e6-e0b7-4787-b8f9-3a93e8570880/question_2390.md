# Q2390: chain fusion: parse authorization header from url signature/domain

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a canister requests Bitcoin/Ethereum/Dogecoin integration data through public management or adapter paths and drive `rs/bitcoin/checker/src/providers.rs`::parse_authorization_header_from_url with attacker-controlled deposit addresses, UTXO sets, withdrawal amounts, destination addresses, ERC20 logs, block heights, and RPC payloads to reuse signatures, transcripts, or request IDs across domains, algorithms, or registry versions; specifically, can this replay or reorder external-chain observations to mint ck tokens twice or skip burn-on-withdrawal accounting, violating the invariant that minter operations must be idempotent across retries, reimbursements, and adapter/RPC inconsistencies, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/checker/src/providers.rs`::parse_authorization_header_from_url
- Entrypoint: a canister requests Bitcoin/Ethereum/Dogecoin integration data through public management or adapter paths
- Attacker controls: deposit addresses, UTXO sets, withdrawal amounts, destination addresses, ERC20 logs, block heights, and RPC payloads
- Exploit idea: replay or reorder external-chain observations to mint ck tokens twice or skip burn-on-withdrawal accounting
- Invariant to test: minter operations must be idempotent across retries, reimbursements, and adapter/RPC inconsistencies
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency; mutate domain separators, registry versions, signer IDs, and message bytes independently
