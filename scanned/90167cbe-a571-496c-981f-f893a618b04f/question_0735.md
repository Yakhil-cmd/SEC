# Q0735: Reap Txs mempool invariant edge f432

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `ReapTxs` in `sei-tendermint/internal/mempool/mempool.go` via public transaction gossip, CheckTx, or mempool recheck flow, controlling transaction bytes, nonce/order, gas values, signatures, account sequence, message mix, and repeated submission timing, and race sequence, nonce, replacement, or recheck behavior to evict valid transactions or keep invalid transactions consuming mempool capacity so that the invariant `nonce/sequence/recheck logic must not let invalid txs crowd out valid txs or delay block production` fails, causing `Medium: Block production delay exceeding 2.5 seconds on realistic validator hardware, caused by crafted transactions or messages`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-tendermint/internal/mempool/mempool.go:429` `ReapTxs`
- Entrypoint: public transaction gossip, CheckTx, or mempool recheck flow
- Attacker controls: transaction bytes, nonce/order, gas values, signatures, account sequence, message mix, and repeated submission timing
- Exploit idea: race sequence, nonce, replacement, or recheck behavior to evict valid transactions or keep invalid transactions consuming mempool capacity
- Invariant to test: nonce/sequence/recheck logic must not let invalid txs crowd out valid txs or delay block production
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium: Block production delay exceeding 2.5 seconds on realistic validator hardware, caused by crafted transactions or messages
- Fast validation: Submit crafted tx bytes through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, and DeliverTx with default config, then compare admission, rejection point, fees, nonce, and elapsed validation time.
