# Q2902: boundary: lookup subnet by canister id replay/idempotency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a web client supplies hostnames, effective canister IDs, request IDs, certified asset paths, and ingress messages and drive `rs/boundary_node/ic_boundary/src/http/handlers.rs`::lookup_subnet_by_canister_id with attacker-controlled hostnames, raw/certified asset routing, rate-limit keys, read_state paths, cache state, and retry timing to replay, repeat, or race an accepted message so the side effect is applied twice or cleanup is skipped; specifically, can this bypass ingress signature/delegation/WebAuthn validation through encoding or request-ID mismatch, violating the invariant that read_state/query/certified asset responses must not be forgeable or stale beyond protocol rules, and produce HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/boundary_node/ic_boundary/src/http/handlers.rs`::lookup_subnet_by_canister_id
- Entrypoint: a web client supplies hostnames, effective canister IDs, request IDs, certified asset paths, and ingress messages
- Attacker controls: hostnames, raw/certified asset routing, rate-limit keys, read_state paths, cache state, and retry timing
- Exploit idea: bypass ingress signature/delegation/WebAuthn validation through encoding or request-ID mismatch
- Invariant to test: read_state/query/certified asset responses must not be forgeable or stale beyond protocol rules
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash
- Fast validation: send crafted HTTP/API requests in a local boundary/replica setup and compare validation, routing, and certification outputs; repeat the same request before and after callback/timer boundaries and assert exactly-once effects
