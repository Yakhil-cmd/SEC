# Q57: ledger: lib ordering/race

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a ledger user submits ICRC/ICP transfer, approve, transfer_from, archive, index, or Rosetta construction calls and drive `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/lib.rs`::lib with attacker-controlled ICRC metadata, allowance expirations, archive callbacks, index sync heights, and duplicate detection fields to reorder callbacks, gossip artifacts, or timer events to violate exactly-once semantics; specifically, can this make ledger, archive, index, or Rosetta derive different balances or transaction IDs for one operation, violating the invariant that duplicate/replay windows must reject repeated value movement under all encodings, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/lib.rs`::lib
- Entrypoint: a ledger user submits ICRC/ICP transfer, approve, transfer_from, archive, index, or Rosetta construction calls
- Attacker controls: ICRC metadata, allowance expirations, archive callbacks, index sync heights, and duplicate detection fields
- Exploit idea: make ledger, archive, index, or Rosetta derive different balances or transaction IDs for one operation
- Invariant to test: duplicate/replay windows must reject repeated value movement under all encodings
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs
