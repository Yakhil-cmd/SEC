# Q1221: ledger: query raw block authorization boundary

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through public query endpoint and drive `rs/rosetta-api/icp/ledger_canister_blocks_synchronizer/src/blocks_access.rs`::query_raw_block with attacker-controlled ICRC metadata, allowance expirations, archive callbacks, index sync heights, and duplicate detection fields to bypass authorization by desynchronizing caller identity, effective canister/account, and validated state; specifically, can this confuse account/subaccount encoding so authorization or accounting applies to the wrong account, violating the invariant that duplicate/replay windows must reject repeated value movement under all encodings, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/rosetta-api/icp/ledger_canister_blocks_synchronizer/src/blocks_access.rs`::query_raw_block
- Entrypoint: public query endpoint
- Attacker controls: ICRC metadata, allowance expirations, archive callbacks, index sync heights, and duplicate detection fields
- Exploit idea: confuse account/subaccount encoding so authorization or accounting applies to the wrong account
- Invariant to test: duplicate/replay windows must reject repeated value movement under all encodings
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs
