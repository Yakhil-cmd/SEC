# Q3081: boundary: verify tls13 signature authorization boundary

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through publicly reachable verification path and drive `rs/boundary_node/ic_boundary/src/tls_verify.rs`::verify_tls13_signature with attacker-controlled HTTP method/path/headers/body, canister ID, subnet ID, request ID, ingress expiry, signatures, and delegations to bypass authorization by desynchronizing caller identity, effective canister/account, and validated state; specifically, can this bypass ingress signature/delegation/WebAuthn validation through encoding or request-ID mismatch, violating the invariant that boundary/API validation must bind request ID, caller, effective canister ID, subnet, and certified response, and produce HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/boundary_node/ic_boundary/src/tls_verify.rs`::verify_tls13_signature
- Entrypoint: publicly reachable verification path
- Attacker controls: HTTP method/path/headers/body, canister ID, subnet ID, request ID, ingress expiry, signatures, and delegations
- Exploit idea: bypass ingress signature/delegation/WebAuthn validation through encoding or request-ID mismatch
- Invariant to test: boundary/API validation must bind request ID, caller, effective canister ID, subnet, and certified response
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash
- Fast validation: send crafted HTTP/API requests in a local boundary/replica setup and compare validation, routing, and certification outputs
