# Q2627: Modes cosmos tx invariant edge 3865

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Modes` in `sei-cosmos/x/auth/tx/legacy_amino_json.go` via public Cosmos SDK transaction or query handler, controlling public message fields, signatures, fees, gas, pagination, addresses, denoms, and repeated transaction ordering, and make two modules interpret the same address, denom, amount, or sequence value differently so that the invariant `public inputs must not make default nodes crash, stall, or commit state that violates module invariants` fails, causing `Medium: Block production delay exceeding 2.5 seconds on realistic validator hardware, caused by crafted transactions or messages`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-cosmos/x/auth/tx/legacy_amino_json.go:25` `Modes`
- Entrypoint: public Cosmos SDK transaction or query handler
- Attacker controls: public message fields, signatures, fees, gas, pagination, addresses, denoms, and repeated transaction ordering
- Exploit idea: make two modules interpret the same address, denom, amount, or sequence value differently
- Invariant to test: public inputs must not make default nodes crash, stall, or commit state that violates module invariants
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium: Block production delay exceeding 2.5 seconds on realistic validator hardware, caused by crafted transactions or messages
- Fast validation: Create a module keeper/msg-server regression test using only public messages, then assert the target invariant before and after success, failure, replay, and batching.
