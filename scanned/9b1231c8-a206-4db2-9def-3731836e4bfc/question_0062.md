# Q62: consensus: check finalization replay/idempotency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an unprivileged ingress sender fills payload candidates that reach consensus validation and drive `rs/artifact_pool/src/consensus_pool_cache.rs`::check_finalization with attacker-controlled ingress batches, payload limits, expiry windows, and repeated admissible messages to replay, repeat, or race an accepted message so the side effect is applied twice or cleanup is skipped; specifically, can this cause block payload construction and validation to disagree about the same state or registry version, violating the invariant that below-threshold peers must not break consensus safety, liveness, or finalized chain uniqueness, and produce HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/artifact_pool/src/consensus_pool_cache.rs`::check_finalization
- Entrypoint: an unprivileged ingress sender fills payload candidates that reach consensus validation
- Attacker controls: ingress batches, payload limits, expiry windows, and repeated admissible messages
- Exploit idea: cause block payload construction and validation to disagree about the same state or registry version
- Invariant to test: below-threshold peers must not break consensus safety, liveness, or finalized chain uniqueness
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization
- Fast validation: construct a local consensus/pool test with two artifact arrival orders and assert identical validation/finalization results; repeat the same request before and after callback/timer boundaries and assert exactly-once effects
