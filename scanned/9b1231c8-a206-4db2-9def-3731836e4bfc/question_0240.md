# Q240: state certification: lib signature/domain

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an ingress/canister flow mutates certified variables then requests witness generation and drive `rs/canonical_state/src/lib.rs`::lib with attacker-controlled partial manifests, duplicate chunks, tree traversal order, and read_state path shape to reuse signatures, transcripts, or request IDs across domains, algorithms, or registry versions; specifically, can this make two different states share an accepted manifest/hash-tree witness under edge-case labels, violating the invariant that read_state witnesses must not prove stale, missing, or forged subnet/canister state, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: forged certified state, invalid state installation, or replicated-state integrity loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/canonical_state/src/lib.rs`::lib
- Entrypoint: an ingress/canister flow mutates certified variables then requests witness generation
- Attacker controls: partial manifests, duplicate chunks, tree traversal order, and read_state path shape
- Exploit idea: make two different states share an accepted manifest/hash-tree witness under edge-case labels
- Invariant to test: read_state witnesses must not prove stale, missing, or forged subnet/canister state
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: forged certified state, invalid state installation, or replicated-state integrity loss
- Fast validation: build a manifest/witness differential test with malformed chunks or labels and assert hash/certification rejection; mutate domain separators, registry versions, signer IDs, and message bytes independently
