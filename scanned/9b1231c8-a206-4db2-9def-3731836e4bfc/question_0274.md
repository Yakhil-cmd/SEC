# Q274: consensus: validate payload resource accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through publicly reachable validation path and drive `rs/consensus/idkg/src/payload_verifier.rs`::validate_payload with attacker-controlled ingress batches, payload limits, expiry windows, and repeated admissible messages to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this race purge/admission logic so a stale but well-formed artifact influences finalization, violating the invariant that below-threshold peers must not break consensus safety, liveness, or finalized chain uniqueness, and produce HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/consensus/idkg/src/payload_verifier.rs`::validate_payload
- Entrypoint: publicly reachable validation path
- Attacker controls: ingress batches, payload limits, expiry windows, and repeated admissible messages
- Exploit idea: race purge/admission logic so a stale but well-formed artifact influences finalization
- Invariant to test: below-threshold peers must not break consensus safety, liveness, or finalized chain uniqueness
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization
- Fast validation: construct a local consensus/pool test with two artifact arrival orders and assert identical validation/finalization results
