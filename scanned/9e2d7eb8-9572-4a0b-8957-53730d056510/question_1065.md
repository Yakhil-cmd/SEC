# Q1065: registry or orchestrator: do add or remove data centers cross module mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a governance proposal or registry client submits node, subnet, routing-table, replica-version, or firewall mutations and drive `rs/registry/canister/src/mutations/do_add_or_remove_data_centers.rs`::do_add_or_remove_data_centers with attacker-controlled node public keys, TLS certs, endpoints, proposal payloads, upgrade metadata, and registry deltas to make producer and consumer modules disagree on height, registry version, state hash, or authorization context; specifically, can this double-apply or skip a rewards/configuration transition due to malformed registry-derived state, violating the invariant that registry mutations must preserve subnet membership, routing, key, version, and upgrade safety invariants, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: consensus configuration compromise, unauthorized node/governance effect, or significant infrastructure integrity loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/registry/canister/src/mutations/do_add_or_remove_data_centers.rs`::do_add_or_remove_data_centers
- Entrypoint: a governance proposal or registry client submits node, subnet, routing-table, replica-version, or firewall mutations
- Attacker controls: node public keys, TLS certs, endpoints, proposal payloads, upgrade metadata, and registry deltas
- Exploit idea: double-apply or skip a rewards/configuration transition due to malformed registry-derived state
- Invariant to test: registry mutations must preserve subnet membership, routing, key, version, and upgrade safety invariants
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: consensus configuration compromise, unauthorized node/governance effect, or significant infrastructure integrity loss
- Fast validation: construct registry mutation/orchestrator-consumer tests and assert invariant validation rejects malformed records
