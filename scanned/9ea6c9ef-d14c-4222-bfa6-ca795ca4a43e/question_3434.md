# Q3434: execution: evic due to process count based on scheduler priorities and last used resource accoun

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an ingress sender installs or upgrades a crafted Wasm module through management-canister flows and drive `rs/canister_sandbox/src/replica_controller/sandbox_process_eviction.rs`::evic_due_to_process_count_based_on_scheduler_priorities_and_last_used with attacker-controlled install/upgrade payloads, canister settings, controllers, memory pages, and execution round timing to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this cause query and replicated execution to disagree about certified or observable state, violating the invariant that instruction, memory, and cycles accounting must remain conserved across retries and callbacks, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/canister_sandbox/src/replica_controller/sandbox_process_eviction.rs`::evic_due_to_process_count_based_on_scheduler_priorities_and_last_used
- Entrypoint: an ingress sender installs or upgrades a crafted Wasm module through management-canister flows
- Attacker controls: install/upgrade payloads, canister settings, controllers, memory pages, and execution round timing
- Exploit idea: cause query and replicated execution to disagree about certified or observable state
- Invariant to test: instruction, memory, and cycles accounting must remain conserved across retries and callbacks
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement
- Fast validation: run a state-machine test with crafted Wasm and assert state, cycles, callbacks, and certified data after trap/retry paths
