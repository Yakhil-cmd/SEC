# Q3148: boundary: Confidentiality Formatting bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an unprivileged user sends malformed signatures, delegations, principals, or WebAuthn credentials to ingress validation and drive `rs/boundary_node/rate_limits/canister/confidentiality_formatting.rs`::ConfidentialityFormatting with attacker-controlled hostnames, raw/certified asset routing, rate-limit keys, read_state paths, cache state, and retry timing to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this bypass ingress signature/delegation/WebAuthn validation through encoding or request-ID mismatch, violating the invariant that malformed public requests must fail closed without crashing in-scope platform components, and produce HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/boundary_node/rate_limits/canister/confidentiality_formatting.rs`::ConfidentialityFormatting
- Entrypoint: an unprivileged user sends malformed signatures, delegations, principals, or WebAuthn credentials to ingress validation
- Attacker controls: hostnames, raw/certified asset routing, rate-limit keys, read_state paths, cache state, and retry timing
- Exploit idea: bypass ingress signature/delegation/WebAuthn validation through encoding or request-ID mismatch
- Invariant to test: malformed public requests must fail closed without crashing in-scope platform components
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash
- Fast validation: send crafted HTTP/API requests in a local boundary/replica setup and compare validation, routing, and certification outputs; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
