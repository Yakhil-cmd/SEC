# Q3399: execution: create sandbox argv certification/witness

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a canister creates nested callbacks, rejects, replies, and DTS pauses that reach execution scheduling and drive `rs/canister_sandbox/src/replica_controller/process_exe_and_args.rs`::create_sandbox_argv with attacker-controlled Wasm bytecode, system API arguments, stable-memory offsets, cycles, callbacks, and reject paths to request or construct certified data with ambiguous paths, labels, or stale state; specifically, can this make pre-trap accounting diverge from post-rollback state for cycles, memory, callbacks, or refunds, violating the invariant that canister lifecycle operations must not bypass controller/effective-canister authorization, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/canister_sandbox/src/replica_controller/process_exe_and_args.rs`::create_sandbox_argv
- Entrypoint: a canister creates nested callbacks, rejects, replies, and DTS pauses that reach execution scheduling
- Attacker controls: Wasm bytecode, system API arguments, stable-memory offsets, cycles, callbacks, and reject paths
- Exploit idea: make pre-trap accounting diverge from post-rollback state for cycles, memory, callbacks, or refunds
- Invariant to test: canister lifecycle operations must not bypass controller/effective-canister authorization
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement
- Fast validation: run a state-machine test with crafted Wasm and assert state, cycles, callbacks, and certified data after trap/retry paths
