# Q1047: Type feegrant invariant edge e137

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Type` in `sei-cosmos/x/feegrant/msgs.go` via public feegrant allowance creation, use, pruning, or revocation flow, controlling granter/grantee addresses, allowance types, spend limits, expiration, fee denom, and transaction fee selection, and make fee deduction use the wrong payer or wrong allowance after an execution error path so that the invariant `feegrant spend limits, periods, denoms, expiration, payer identity, and actual fee deduction must remain synchronized` fails, causing `Low: Manipulation of transaction fee calculation resulting in fees outside protocol-defined bounds`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-cosmos/x/feegrant/msgs.go:130` `Type`
- Entrypoint: public feegrant allowance creation, use, pruning, or revocation flow
- Attacker controls: granter/grantee addresses, allowance types, spend limits, expiration, fee denom, and transaction fee selection
- Exploit idea: make fee deduction use the wrong payer or wrong allowance after an execution error path
- Invariant to test: feegrant spend limits, periods, denoms, expiration, payer identity, and actual fee deduction must remain synchronized
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low: Manipulation of transaction fee calculation resulting in fees outside protocol-defined bounds
- Fast validation: Create feegrant allowances, execute paid and failing transactions with edge fees, and assert allowance consumption equals actual protocol fee deduction.
