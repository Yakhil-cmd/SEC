# Q1798: ledger: Partial Eq bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an exchange/client sends Rosetta API requests with crafted operations, blocks, metadata, or signatures and drive `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc1/account.rs`::PartialEq with attacker-controlled accounts, subaccounts, spender, amount, fee, memo, created_at_time, block index, operation order, and signatures to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this bypass duplicate detection or allowance decrementing by racing replayed but differently encoded requests, violating the invariant that archive and index views must not create spendable balance or hide finalized debits, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc1/account.rs`::PartialEq
- Entrypoint: an exchange/client sends Rosetta API requests with crafted operations, blocks, metadata, or signatures
- Attacker controls: accounts, subaccounts, spender, amount, fee, memo, created_at_time, block index, operation order, and signatures
- Exploit idea: bypass duplicate detection or allowance decrementing by racing replayed but differently encoded requests
- Invariant to test: archive and index views must not create spendable balance or hide finalized debits
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
