# Q1056: Pick Vote To Send consensus invariant edge 2122

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `PickVoteToSend` in `sei-tendermint/internal/consensus/peer_state.go` via publicly submitted transaction or peer-delivered block/proposal data processed by validators, controlling transaction payloads, proposer-included ordering, block data size, evidence payloads, and peer-visible proposal inputs, and make honest validators accept different derived state from the same public transaction or proposal data so that the invariant `all honest validators must deterministically derive the same app state and block validity from the same proposal` fails, causing `High: Network not being able to confirm new transactions from total shutdown or consensus failure`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-tendermint/internal/consensus/peer_state.go:156` `PickVoteToSend`
- Entrypoint: publicly submitted transaction or peer-delivered block/proposal data processed by validators
- Attacker controls: transaction payloads, proposer-included ordering, block data size, evidence payloads, and peer-visible proposal inputs
- Exploit idea: make honest validators accept different derived state from the same public transaction or proposal data
- Invariant to test: all honest validators must deterministically derive the same app state and block validity from the same proposal
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: Network not being able to confirm new transactions from total shutdown or consensus failure
- Fast validation: Run a two-validator localnet or deterministic state test, feed the crafted tx/proposal/evidence, and compare app hash, block result, panic behavior, and processing time.
