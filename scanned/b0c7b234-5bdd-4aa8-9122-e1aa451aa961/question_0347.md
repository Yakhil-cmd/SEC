# Q0347: Check And Decode Signature evm core invariant edge c7cb

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `CheckAndDecodeSignature` in `app/ante/evm_checktx.go` via public EVM transaction through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, or DeliverTx, controlling EVM tx type, chain id, nonce, gas caps, access list, calldata, value, authorization list, and account association state, and trigger a revert/error path after partial fee, nonce, or balance updates and leave protocol accounting inconsistent so that the invariant `all validators must reject or accept the same public EVM transaction with the same state side effects` fails, causing `Critical: Permanent freezing of user funds of USD $5,000 or more`?

## Target
- File/function: `app/ante/evm_checktx.go:200` `CheckAndDecodeSignature`
- Entrypoint: public EVM transaction through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, or DeliverTx
- Attacker controls: EVM tx type, chain id, nonce, gas caps, access list, calldata, value, authorization list, and account association state
- Exploit idea: trigger a revert/error path after partial fee, nonce, or balance updates and leave protocol accounting inconsistent
- Invariant to test: all validators must reject or accept the same public EVM transaction with the same state side effects
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: Permanent freezing of user funds of USD $5,000 or more
- Fast validation: Run the tx through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, DeliverTx, and receipt query paths, then diff nonce, balance, gas, logs, receipts, and committed state.
