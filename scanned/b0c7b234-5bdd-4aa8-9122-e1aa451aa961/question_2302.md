# Q2302: Set Curr Base Fee Per Gas evm core invariant edge 6d36

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `SetCurrBaseFeePerGas` in `x/evm/keeper/fee.go` via public EVM transaction through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, or DeliverTx, controlling EVM tx type, chain id, nonce, gas caps, access list, calldata, value, authorization list, and account association state, and use transaction type edge cases to pass one validator path and fail another with different state side effects so that the invariant `all validators must reject or accept the same public EVM transaction with the same state side effects` fails, causing `Low: Manipulation of transaction fee calculation resulting in fees outside protocol-defined bounds`?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/fee.go:82` `SetCurrBaseFeePerGas`
- Entrypoint: public EVM transaction through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, or DeliverTx
- Attacker controls: EVM tx type, chain id, nonce, gas caps, access list, calldata, value, authorization list, and account association state
- Exploit idea: use transaction type edge cases to pass one validator path and fail another with different state side effects
- Invariant to test: all validators must reject or accept the same public EVM transaction with the same state side effects
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low: Manipulation of transaction fee calculation resulting in fees outside protocol-defined bounds
- Fast validation: Run the tx through CheckTx, ProcessProposal, DeliverTx, and receipt query paths, then diff nonce, balance, gas, logs, receipts, and committed state.
