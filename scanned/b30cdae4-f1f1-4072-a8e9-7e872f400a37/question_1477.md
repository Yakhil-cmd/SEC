# Q1477: types packages: add ordering/race

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a public API caller submits encoded Candid/CBOR/protobuf values that decode into shared protocol types and drive `rs/types/types/src/time.rs`::add with attacker-controlled encoded bytes, enum variants, optional fields, principals, account IDs, amounts, timestamps, hashes, and signatures to reorder callbacks, gossip artifacts, or timer events to violate exactly-once semantics; specifically, can this confuse canonical hashing/signing by changing field order, unknown fields, or conversion defaults, violating the invariant that unknown or malformed variants must fail closed before state transition logic, and produce HackenProof High/Medium: authorization bypass, accounting mismatch, signature confusion, or production platform crash?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/types/types/src/time.rs`::add
- Entrypoint: a public API caller submits encoded Candid/CBOR/protobuf values that decode into shared protocol types
- Attacker controls: encoded bytes, enum variants, optional fields, principals, account IDs, amounts, timestamps, hashes, and signatures
- Exploit idea: confuse canonical hashing/signing by changing field order, unknown fields, or conversion defaults
- Invariant to test: unknown or malformed variants must fail closed before state transition logic
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Medium: authorization bypass, accounting mismatch, signature confusion, or production platform crash
- Fast validation: fuzz type round trips and differential consumers, then assert canonical equality, rejection, and no overflow/aliasing
