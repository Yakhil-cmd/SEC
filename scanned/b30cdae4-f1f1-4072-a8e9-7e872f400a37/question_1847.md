# Q1847: ledger: add account ordering/race

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a spender races allowance, transfer_from, fee, memo, timestamp, and duplicate transaction windows and drive `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc21/responses.rs`::add_account with attacker-controlled accounts, subaccounts, spender, amount, fee, memo, created_at_time, block index, operation order, and signatures to reorder callbacks, gossip artifacts, or timer events to violate exactly-once semantics; specifically, can this bypass duplicate detection or allowance decrementing by racing replayed but differently encoded requests, violating the invariant that ledger balances plus fees must be conserved across transfer, approve, transfer_from, archive, and index paths, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc21/responses.rs`::add_account
- Entrypoint: a spender races allowance, transfer_from, fee, memo, timestamp, and duplicate transaction windows
- Attacker controls: accounts, subaccounts, spender, amount, fee, memo, created_at_time, block index, operation order, and signatures
- Exploit idea: bypass duplicate detection or allowance decrementing by racing replayed but differently encoded requests
- Invariant to test: ledger balances plus fees must be conserved across transfer, approve, transfer_from, archive, and index paths
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs
