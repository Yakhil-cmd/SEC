# Q42: ledger: Icrc152 Mint Args replay/idempotency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an exchange/client sends Rosetta API requests with crafted operations, blocks, metadata, or signatures and drive `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc152/mod.rs`::Icrc152MintArgs with attacker-controlled ICRC metadata, allowance expirations, archive callbacks, index sync heights, and duplicate detection fields to replay, repeat, or race an accepted message so the side effect is applied twice or cleanup is skipped; specifically, can this undercharge fees or mis-handle refunds when transfer/approval state changes across retries, violating the invariant that archive and index views must not create spendable balance or hide finalized debits, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc152/mod.rs`::Icrc152MintArgs
- Entrypoint: an exchange/client sends Rosetta API requests with crafted operations, blocks, metadata, or signatures
- Attacker controls: ICRC metadata, allowance expirations, archive callbacks, index sync heights, and duplicate detection fields
- Exploit idea: undercharge fees or mis-handle refunds when transfer/approval state changes across retries
- Invariant to test: archive and index views must not create spendable balance or hide finalized debits
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs; repeat the same request before and after callback/timer boundaries and assert exactly-once effects
