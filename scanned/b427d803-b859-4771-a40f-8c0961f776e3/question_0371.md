# Q371: crypto: arbitrary key set with pop authorization boundary

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a boundary/API caller submits WebAuthn, canister-signature, TLS, or basic-signature material and drive `rs/crypto/internal/crypto_lib/threshold_sig/bls12_381/src/ni_dkg/groth20_bls12_381/types/arbitrary.rs`::arbitrary_key_set_with_pop with attacker-controlled transcripts, dealings, complaints, openings, signature shares, derivation paths, and message bytes to bypass authorization by desynchronizing caller identity, effective canister/account, and validated state; specifically, can this bypass subgroup, canonical encoding, or domain-separation checks for a threshold-signature operation, violating the invariant that cryptographic verification must bind message, domain, signer set, registry version, and transcript ID, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/crypto/internal/crypto_lib/threshold_sig/bls12_381/src/ni_dkg/groth20_bls12_381/types/arbitrary.rs`::arbitrary_key_set_with_pop
- Entrypoint: a boundary/API caller submits WebAuthn, canister-signature, TLS, or basic-signature material
- Attacker controls: transcripts, dealings, complaints, openings, signature shares, derivation paths, and message bytes
- Exploit idea: bypass subgroup, canonical encoding, or domain-separation checks for a threshold-signature operation
- Invariant to test: cryptographic verification must bind message, domain, signer set, registry version, and transcript ID
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass
- Fast validation: fuzz encodings/transcripts/signature shares and assert verification rejects cross-domain or malformed variants
