# Q771: ledger: hash cbor authorization boundary

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a spender races allowance, transfer_from, fee, memo, timestamp, and duplicate transaction windows and drive `rs/ledger_suite/icrc1/src/hash.rs`::hash_cbor with attacker-controlled ICRC metadata, allowance expirations, archive callbacks, index sync heights, and duplicate detection fields to bypass authorization by desynchronizing caller identity, effective canister/account, and validated state; specifically, can this confuse account/subaccount encoding so authorization or accounting applies to the wrong account, violating the invariant that ledger balances plus fees must be conserved across transfer, approve, transfer_from, archive, and index paths, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/ledger_suite/icrc1/src/hash.rs`::hash_cbor
- Entrypoint: a spender races allowance, transfer_from, fee, memo, timestamp, and duplicate transaction windows
- Attacker controls: ICRC metadata, allowance expirations, archive callbacks, index sync heights, and duplicate detection fields
- Exploit idea: confuse account/subaccount encoding so authorization or accounting applies to the wrong account
- Invariant to test: ledger balances plus fees must be conserved across transfer, approve, transfer_from, archive, and index paths
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs
