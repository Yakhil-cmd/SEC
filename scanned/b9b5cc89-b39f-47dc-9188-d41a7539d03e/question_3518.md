# Q3518: execution: resume execution bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an ingress sender installs or upgrades a crafted Wasm module through management-canister flows and drive `rs/canister_sandbox/src/sandbox_service.rs`::resume_execution with attacker-controlled message queues, response payloads, instruction limits, heap growth, and rollback-triggering traps to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this cause query and replicated execution to disagree about certified or observable state, violating the invariant that instruction, memory, and cycles accounting must remain conserved across retries and callbacks, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/canister_sandbox/src/sandbox_service.rs`::resume_execution
- Entrypoint: an ingress sender installs or upgrades a crafted Wasm module through management-canister flows
- Attacker controls: message queues, response payloads, instruction limits, heap growth, and rollback-triggering traps
- Exploit idea: cause query and replicated execution to disagree about certified or observable state
- Invariant to test: instruction, memory, and cycles accounting must remain conserved across retries and callbacks
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement
- Fast validation: run a state-machine test with crafted Wasm and assert state, cycles, callbacks, and certified data after trap/retry paths; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
