# Q3404: execution: check binary signature resource accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through public signature or threshold-signing request path and drive `rs/canister_sandbox/src/replica_controller/process_exe_and_args.rs`::check_binary_signature with attacker-controlled message queues, response payloads, instruction limits, heap growth, and rollback-triggering traps to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this exploit a DTS pause/resume boundary to reuse stale execution state or duplicate a response, violating the invariant that canister execution must be deterministic and rollback all state/cycles effects after traps, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/canister_sandbox/src/replica_controller/process_exe_and_args.rs`::check_binary_signature
- Entrypoint: public signature or threshold-signing request path
- Attacker controls: message queues, response payloads, instruction limits, heap growth, and rollback-triggering traps
- Exploit idea: exploit a DTS pause/resume boundary to reuse stale execution state or duplicate a response
- Invariant to test: canister execution must be deterministic and rollback all state/cycles effects after traps
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement
- Fast validation: run a state-machine test with crafted Wasm and assert state, cycles, callbacks, and certified data after trap/retry paths
