# Q1446: crypto: Dkg Create Dealing Error rollback edge case

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a protocol peer submits malformed DKG/IDKG dealings, complaints, openings, or signature shares and drive `rs/types/types/src/crypto/threshold_sig/ni_dkg/errors/create_dealing_error.rs`::DkgCreateDealingError with attacker-controlled signature algorithms, threshold contexts, node IDs, registry versions, and malformed group elements to force an error path after partial mutation and verify the state transition rolls back completely; specifically, can this cause complaint/opening handling to retain, remove, or reveal key material under wrong transcript IDs, violating the invariant that node/canister/TLS key validation must not accept keys outside the registered identity context, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/types/types/src/crypto/threshold_sig/ni_dkg/errors/create_dealing_error.rs`::DkgCreateDealingError
- Entrypoint: a protocol peer submits malformed DKG/IDKG dealings, complaints, openings, or signature shares
- Attacker controls: signature algorithms, threshold contexts, node IDs, registry versions, and malformed group elements
- Exploit idea: cause complaint/opening handling to retain, remove, or reveal key material under wrong transcript IDs
- Invariant to test: node/canister/TLS key validation must not accept keys outside the registered identity context
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass
- Fast validation: fuzz encodings/transcripts/signature shares and assert verification rejects cross-domain or malformed variants
