# Q3904: consensus: get validated dealings resource accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through publicly reachable validation path and drive `rs/consensus/idkg/src/payload_builder.rs`::get_validated_dealings with attacker-controlled ingress batches, payload limits, expiry windows, and repeated admissible messages to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this trigger inconsistent handling of oversized or duplicated payload sections before notarization, violating the invariant that honest replicas must not finalize or notarize a block that fails deterministic validation, and produce HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/consensus/idkg/src/payload_builder.rs`::get_validated_dealings
- Entrypoint: publicly reachable validation path
- Attacker controls: ingress batches, payload limits, expiry windows, and repeated admissible messages
- Exploit idea: trigger inconsistent handling of oversized or duplicated payload sections before notarization
- Invariant to test: honest replicas must not finalize or notarize a block that fails deterministic validation
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization
- Fast validation: construct a local consensus/pool test with two artifact arrival orders and assert identical validation/finalization results
