# Q888: nns governance: from api bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a user interacts with CMC/GTC/SNS-W/root/lifeline canister methods without privileged authority and drive `rs/nns/governance/src/neuron/dissolve_state_and_age.rs`::from_api with attacker-controlled proposal payloads, followee lists, hotkeys, permissions, ledger transfer metadata, and retry timing to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this double-apply a proposal/neuron state transition through retry, timer, or inter-canister callback ordering, violating the invariant that governance and ledger state must stay conserved across retries, callbacks, and failed transfers, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: unauthorized NNS governance/neuron access or theft/illegal minting of ICP/Cycles/assets?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/nns/governance/src/neuron/dissolve_state_and_age.rs`::from_api
- Entrypoint: a user interacts with CMC/GTC/SNS-W/root/lifeline canister methods without privileged authority
- Attacker controls: proposal payloads, followee lists, hotkeys, permissions, ledger transfer metadata, and retry timing
- Exploit idea: double-apply a proposal/neuron state transition through retry, timer, or inter-canister callback ordering
- Invariant to test: governance and ledger state must stay conserved across retries, callbacks, and failed transfers
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: unauthorized NNS governance/neuron access or theft/illegal minting of ICP/Cycles/assets
- Fast validation: write a PocketIC/state-machine test that races the public governance call and asserts permissions/accounting/exactly-once execution; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
