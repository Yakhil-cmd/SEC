# Q2474: chain fusion: Guard Error resource accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a canister requests Bitcoin/Ethereum/Dogecoin integration data through public management or adapter paths and drive `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/guard.rs`::GuardError with attacker-controlled minter state transitions, retry ordering, chain-key signature requests, and external-chain transaction encodings to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this cause minter and ledger state to diverge after a failed withdrawal, reimbursement, or callback retry, violating the invariant that minter operations must be idempotent across retries, reimbursements, and adapter/RPC inconsistencies, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/guard.rs`::GuardError
- Entrypoint: a canister requests Bitcoin/Ethereum/Dogecoin integration data through public management or adapter paths
- Attacker controls: minter state transitions, retry ordering, chain-key signature requests, and external-chain transaction encodings
- Exploit idea: cause minter and ledger state to diverge after a failed withdrawal, reimbursement, or callback retry
- Invariant to test: minter operations must be idempotent across retries, reimbursements, and adapter/RPC inconsistencies
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency
