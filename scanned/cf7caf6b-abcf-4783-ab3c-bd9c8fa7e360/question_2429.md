# Q2429: chain fusion: derive public key from account certification/witness

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a ckBTC/ckETH/ckERC20/ckDOGE user submits deposit, withdrawal, update-balance, retrieve, or reimbursement calls and drive `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/address.rs`::derive_public_key_from_account with attacker-controlled memos, reimbursement IDs, transaction status, fee estimates, finality depth, adapter responses, and ledger callbacks to request or construct certified data with ambiguous paths, labels, or stale state; specifically, can this accept an external-chain log/UTXO/transaction under the wrong finality, address, token, or chain context, violating the invariant that ck-token supply must be conserved against finalized external-chain deposits and withdrawals, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/address.rs`::derive_public_key_from_account
- Entrypoint: a ckBTC/ckETH/ckERC20/ckDOGE user submits deposit, withdrawal, update-balance, retrieve, or reimbursement calls
- Attacker controls: memos, reimbursement IDs, transaction status, fee estimates, finality depth, adapter responses, and ledger callbacks
- Exploit idea: accept an external-chain log/UTXO/transaction under the wrong finality, address, token, or chain context
- Invariant to test: ck-token supply must be conserved against finalized external-chain deposits and withdrawals
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency
