# Q3536: execution: install file descriptors rollback edge case

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a caller submits ingress that drives canister lifecycle, cycle transfer, and stable-memory paths and drive `rs/canister_sandbox/src/transport.rs`::install_file_descriptors with attacker-controlled install/upgrade payloads, canister settings, controllers, memory pages, and execution round timing to force an error path after partial mutation and verify the state transition rolls back completely; specifically, can this cause query and replicated execution to disagree about certified or observable state, violating the invariant that canister execution must be deterministic and rollback all state/cycles effects after traps, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/canister_sandbox/src/transport.rs`::install_file_descriptors
- Entrypoint: a caller submits ingress that drives canister lifecycle, cycle transfer, and stable-memory paths
- Attacker controls: install/upgrade payloads, canister settings, controllers, memory pages, and execution round timing
- Exploit idea: cause query and replicated execution to disagree about certified or observable state
- Invariant to test: canister execution must be deterministic and rollback all state/cycles effects after traps
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement
- Fast validation: run a state-machine test with crafted Wasm and assert state, cycles, callbacks, and certified data after trap/retry paths
