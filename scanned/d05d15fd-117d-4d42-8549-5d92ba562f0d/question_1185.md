# Q1185: Default Mode cosmos tx invariant edge 7a01

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `DefaultMode` in `sei-cosmos/x/auth/legacy/legacytx/amino_signing.go` via public Cosmos SDK transaction or query handler, controlling public message fields, signatures, fees, gas, pagination, addresses, denoms, and repeated transaction ordering, and make two modules interpret the same address, denom, amount, or sequence value differently so that the invariant `module keepers must preserve balances, authorization, sequence, gas, and state invariants for every public transaction path` fails, causing `Medium: Block production delay exceeding 2.5 seconds on realistic validator hardware, caused by crafted transactions or messages`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-cosmos/x/auth/legacy/legacytx/amino_signing.go:25` `DefaultMode`
- Entrypoint: public Cosmos SDK transaction or query handler
- Attacker controls: public message fields, signatures, fees, gas, pagination, addresses, denoms, and repeated transaction ordering
- Exploit idea: make two modules interpret the same address, denom, amount, or sequence value differently
- Invariant to test: module keepers must preserve balances, authorization, sequence, gas, and state invariants for every public transaction path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium: Block production delay exceeding 2.5 seconds on realistic validator hardware, caused by crafted transactions or messages
- Fast validation: Create a module keeper/msg-server regression test using only public messages, then assert the target invariant before and after success, failure, replay, and batching.
