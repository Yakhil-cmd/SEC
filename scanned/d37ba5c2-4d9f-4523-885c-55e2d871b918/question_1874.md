# Q1874: ledger: Get Blocks Response resource accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an exchange/client sends Rosetta API requests with crafted operations, blocks, metadata, or signatures and drive `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc3/blocks.rs`::GetBlocksResponse with attacker-controlled accounts, subaccounts, spender, amount, fee, memo, created_at_time, block index, operation order, and signatures to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this confuse account/subaccount encoding so authorization or accounting applies to the wrong account, violating the invariant that archive and index views must not create spendable balance or hide finalized debits, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc3/blocks.rs`::GetBlocksResponse
- Entrypoint: an exchange/client sends Rosetta API requests with crafted operations, blocks, metadata, or signatures
- Attacker controls: accounts, subaccounts, spender, amount, fee, memo, created_at_time, block index, operation order, and signatures
- Exploit idea: confuse account/subaccount encoding so authorization or accounting applies to the wrong account
- Invariant to test: archive and index views must not create spendable balance or hide finalized debits
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs
