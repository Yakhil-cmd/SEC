# Q1233: ledger: read blocks canonical encoding

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a ledger user submits ICRC/ICP transfer, approve, transfer_from, archive, index, or Rosetta construction calls and drive `rs/rosetta-api/icp/src/ledger_client.rs`::read_blocks with attacker-controlled Rosetta construction payloads, transaction identifiers, block ranges, ledger responses, and retry timing to use alternative encodings or unknown fields so validation and execution interpret different values; specifically, can this confuse account/subaccount encoding so authorization or accounting applies to the wrong account, violating the invariant that duplicate/replay windows must reject repeated value movement under all encodings, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/rosetta-api/icp/src/ledger_client.rs`::read_blocks
- Entrypoint: a ledger user submits ICRC/ICP transfer, approve, transfer_from, archive, index, or Rosetta construction calls
- Attacker controls: Rosetta construction payloads, transaction identifiers, block ranges, ledger responses, and retry timing
- Exploit idea: confuse account/subaccount encoding so authorization or accounting applies to the wrong account
- Invariant to test: duplicate/replay windows must reject repeated value movement under all encodings
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs; add differential encode/decode cases for unknown fields, alternate lengths, and canonical hashes
