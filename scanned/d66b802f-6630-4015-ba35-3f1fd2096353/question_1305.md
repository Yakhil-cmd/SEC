# Q1305: ledger: verify and fix gaps cross module mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through publicly reachable verification path and drive `rs/rosetta-api/icrc1/src/ledger_blocks_synchronization/blocks_synchronizer.rs`::verify_and_fix_gaps with attacker-controlled accounts, subaccounts, spender, amount, fee, memo, created_at_time, block index, operation order, and signatures to make producer and consumer modules disagree on height, registry version, state hash, or authorization context; specifically, can this make ledger, archive, index, or Rosetta derive different balances or transaction IDs for one operation, violating the invariant that duplicate/replay windows must reject repeated value movement under all encodings, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/rosetta-api/icrc1/src/ledger_blocks_synchronization/blocks_synchronizer.rs`::verify_and_fix_gaps
- Entrypoint: publicly reachable verification path
- Attacker controls: accounts, subaccounts, spender, amount, fee, memo, created_at_time, block index, operation order, and signatures
- Exploit idea: make ledger, archive, index, or Rosetta derive different balances or transaction IDs for one operation
- Invariant to test: duplicate/replay windows must reject repeated value movement under all encodings
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs
