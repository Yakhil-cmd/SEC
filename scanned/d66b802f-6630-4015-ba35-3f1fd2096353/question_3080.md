# Q3080: boundary: verify tls12 signature signature/domain

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through publicly reachable verification path and drive `rs/boundary_node/ic_boundary/src/tls_verify.rs`::verify_tls12_signature with attacker-controlled Candid/CBOR/protobuf payloads, WebAuthn fields, effective-canister ID, and boundary node request ordering to reuse signatures, transcripts, or request IDs across domains, algorithms, or registry versions; specifically, can this serve stale or forged certified data by confusing cache keys, hostnames, or read_state witness paths, violating the invariant that malformed public requests must fail closed without crashing in-scope platform components, and produce HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/boundary_node/ic_boundary/src/tls_verify.rs`::verify_tls12_signature
- Entrypoint: publicly reachable verification path
- Attacker controls: Candid/CBOR/protobuf payloads, WebAuthn fields, effective-canister ID, and boundary node request ordering
- Exploit idea: serve stale or forged certified data by confusing cache keys, hostnames, or read_state witness paths
- Invariant to test: malformed public requests must fail closed without crashing in-scope platform components
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash
- Fast validation: send crafted HTTP/API requests in a local boundary/replica setup and compare validation, routing, and certification outputs; mutate domain separators, registry versions, signer IDs, and message bytes independently
