# Q632: execution: real replay/idempotency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a caller submits ingress that drives canister lifecycle, cycle transfer, and stable-memory paths and drive `rs/execution_environment/src/execution_environment.rs`::real with attacker-controlled message queues, response payloads, instruction limits, heap growth, and rollback-triggering traps to replay, repeat, or race an accepted message so the side effect is applied twice or cleanup is skipped; specifically, can this make pre-trap accounting diverge from post-rollback state for cycles, memory, callbacks, or refunds, violating the invariant that canister execution must be deterministic and rollback all state/cycles effects after traps, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/execution_environment/src/execution_environment.rs`::real
- Entrypoint: a caller submits ingress that drives canister lifecycle, cycle transfer, and stable-memory paths
- Attacker controls: message queues, response payloads, instruction limits, heap growth, and rollback-triggering traps
- Exploit idea: make pre-trap accounting diverge from post-rollback state for cycles, memory, callbacks, or refunds
- Invariant to test: canister execution must be deterministic and rollback all state/cycles effects after traps
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: canister integrity loss, unauthorized state mutation, or illegal cycles/funds movement
- Fast validation: run a state-machine test with crafted Wasm and assert state, cycles, callbacks, and certified data after trap/retry paths; repeat the same request before and after callback/timer boundaries and assert exactly-once effects
