# Q772: ledger: known tags replay/idempotency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a caller queries archive/index state while ledger blocks are being appended or synchronized and drive `rs/ledger_suite/icrc1/src/known_tags.rs`::known_tags with attacker-controlled Rosetta construction payloads, transaction identifiers, block ranges, ledger responses, and retry timing to replay, repeat, or race an accepted message so the side effect is applied twice or cleanup is skipped; specifically, can this undercharge fees or mis-handle refunds when transfer/approval state changes across retries, violating the invariant that Rosetta construction/parse/submit must map one signed transaction to one ledger effect, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/ledger_suite/icrc1/src/known_tags.rs`::known_tags
- Entrypoint: a caller queries archive/index state while ledger blocks are being appended or synchronized
- Attacker controls: Rosetta construction payloads, transaction identifiers, block ranges, ledger responses, and retry timing
- Exploit idea: undercharge fees or mis-handle refunds when transfer/approval state changes across retries
- Invariant to test: Rosetta construction/parse/submit must map one signed transaction to one ledger effect
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs; repeat the same request before and after callback/timer boundaries and assert exactly-once effects
