# Q0293: New Set Up Context Decorator cosmos tx invariant edge f1bb

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `NewSetUpContextDecorator` in `sei-cosmos/x/auth/ante/setup.go` via public Cosmos SDK transaction or query handler, controlling public message fields, signatures, fees, gas, pagination, addresses, denoms, and repeated transaction ordering, and make two modules interpret the same address, denom, amount, or sequence value differently so that the invariant `public inputs must not make default nodes crash, stall, or commit state that violates module invariants` fails, causing `Critical: Direct loss of user funds of USD $5,000 or more, excluding gas fees and yield`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-cosmos/x/auth/ante/setup.go:36` `NewSetUpContextDecorator`
- Entrypoint: public Cosmos SDK transaction or query handler
- Attacker controls: public message fields, signatures, fees, gas, pagination, addresses, denoms, and repeated transaction ordering
- Exploit idea: make two modules interpret the same address, denom, amount, or sequence value differently
- Invariant to test: public inputs must not make default nodes crash, stall, or commit state that violates module invariants
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: Direct loss of user funds of USD $5,000 or more, excluding gas fees and yield
- Fast validation: Create a module keeper/msg-server regression test using only public messages, then assert the target invariant before and after success, failure, replay, and batching.
