# Q2868: boundary: sign bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through public signature or threshold-signing request path and drive `rs/boundary_node/ic_boundary/src/core.rs`::sign with attacker-controlled HTTP method/path/headers/body, canister ID, subnet ID, request ID, ingress expiry, signatures, and delegations to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this trigger non-volumetric platform-level crash via a malformed but protocol-valid API request, violating the invariant that malformed public requests must fail closed without crashing in-scope platform components, and produce HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/boundary_node/ic_boundary/src/core.rs`::sign
- Entrypoint: public signature or threshold-signing request path
- Attacker controls: HTTP method/path/headers/body, canister ID, subnet ID, request ID, ingress expiry, signatures, and delegations
- Exploit idea: trigger non-volumetric platform-level crash via a malformed but protocol-valid API request
- Invariant to test: malformed public requests must fail closed without crashing in-scope platform components
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Medium: boundary validation bypass, forged certified response, limited key/session exposure, or platform-level crash
- Fast validation: send crafted HTTP/API requests in a local boundary/replica setup and compare validation, routing, and certification outputs; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
