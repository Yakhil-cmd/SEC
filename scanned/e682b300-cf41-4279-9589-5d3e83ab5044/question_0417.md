# Q417: crypto: threshold sign ordering/race

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through public signature or threshold-signing request path and drive `rs/crypto/internal/crypto_service_provider/src/api/threshold.rs`::threshold_sign with attacker-controlled DER/COSE/protobuf encodings, curve points, public keys, domain separators, and registry key records to reorder callbacks, gossip artifacts, or timer events to violate exactly-once semantics; specifically, can this bypass subgroup, canonical encoding, or domain-separation checks for a threshold-signature operation, violating the invariant that threshold protocols must not leak key shares or sign unauthorized messages below threshold compromise, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/crypto/internal/crypto_service_provider/src/api/threshold.rs`::threshold_sign
- Entrypoint: public signature or threshold-signing request path
- Attacker controls: DER/COSE/protobuf encodings, curve points, public keys, domain separators, and registry key records
- Exploit idea: bypass subgroup, canonical encoding, or domain-separation checks for a threshold-signature operation
- Invariant to test: threshold protocols must not leak key shares or sign unauthorized messages below threshold compromise
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: subnet key-share disclosure, unauthorized threshold signature, or authentication bypass
- Fast validation: fuzz encodings/transcripts/signature shares and assert verification rejects cross-domain or malformed variants
