# Q1788: ledger: from str bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a caller queries archive/index state while ledger blocks are being appended or synchronized and drive `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc1/account.rs`::from_str with attacker-controlled Rosetta construction payloads, transaction identifiers, block ranges, ledger responses, and retry timing to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this undercharge fees or mis-handle refunds when transfer/approval state changes across retries, violating the invariant that Rosetta construction/parse/submit must map one signed transaction to one ledger effect, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc1/account.rs`::from_str
- Entrypoint: a caller queries archive/index state while ledger blocks are being appended or synchronized
- Attacker controls: Rosetta construction payloads, transaction identifiers, block ranges, ledger responses, and retry timing
- Exploit idea: undercharge fees or mis-handle refunds when transfer/approval state changes across retries
- Invariant to test: Rosetta construction/parse/submit must map one signed transaction to one ledger effect
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
