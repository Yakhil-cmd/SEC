# Q584: chain fusion: guarded principals resource accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a protocol peer or adapter client supplies chain-fusion payloads that enter consensus or minter state and drive `rs/ethereum/cketh/minter/src/guard/mod.rs`::guarded_principals with attacker-controlled memos, reimbursement IDs, transaction status, fee estimates, finality depth, adapter responses, and ledger callbacks to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this replay or reorder external-chain observations to mint ck tokens twice or skip burn-on-withdrawal accounting, violating the invariant that threshold signing must only authorize transactions derived from valid minter state, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/ethereum/cketh/minter/src/guard/mod.rs`::guarded_principals
- Entrypoint: a protocol peer or adapter client supplies chain-fusion payloads that enter consensus or minter state
- Attacker controls: memos, reimbursement IDs, transaction status, fee estimates, finality depth, adapter responses, and ledger callbacks
- Exploit idea: replay or reorder external-chain observations to mint ck tokens twice or skip burn-on-withdrawal accounting
- Invariant to test: threshold signing must only authorize transactions derived from valid minter state
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency
