# Q1858: ledger: Consent Message bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an exchange/client sends Rosetta API requests with crafted operations, blocks, metadata, or signatures and drive `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc21/responses.rs`::ConsentMessage with attacker-controlled ICRC metadata, allowance expirations, archive callbacks, index sync heights, and duplicate detection fields to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this confuse account/subaccount encoding so authorization or accounting applies to the wrong account, violating the invariant that archive and index views must not create spendable balance or hide finalized debits, and produce HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure?

## Target
- File/function: `packages/icrc-ledger-types/src/icrc21/responses.rs`::ConsentMessage
- Entrypoint: an exchange/client sends Rosetta API requests with crafted operations, blocks, metadata, or signatures
- Attacker controls: ICRC metadata, allowance expirations, archive callbacks, index sync heights, and duplicate detection fields
- Exploit idea: confuse account/subaccount encoding so authorization or accounting applies to the wrong account
- Invariant to test: archive and index views must not create spendable balance or hide finalized debits
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof High/Critical: theft, illegal minting, fund freezing, or exchange-facing ledger integrity failure
- Fast validation: run ledger/Rosetta state-machine tests with replayed operations and assert balance conservation and one-to-one transaction IDs; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
