# Q1049: registry or orchestrator: check firewall invariants certification/witness

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a governance proposal or registry client submits node, subnet, routing-table, replica-version, or firewall mutations and drive `rs/registry/canister/src/invariants/firewall.rs`::check_firewall_invariants with attacker-controlled NNS-approved but attacker-crafted record fields, ordering of deltas, and retry timing around upgrades to request or construct certified data with ambiguous paths, labels, or stale state; specifically, can this double-apply or skip a rewards/configuration transition due to malformed registry-derived state, violating the invariant that registry mutations must preserve subnet membership, routing, key, version, and upgrade safety invariants, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: consensus configuration compromise, unauthorized node/governance effect, or significant infrastructure integrity loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/registry/canister/src/invariants/firewall.rs`::check_firewall_invariants
- Entrypoint: a governance proposal or registry client submits node, subnet, routing-table, replica-version, or firewall mutations
- Attacker controls: NNS-approved but attacker-crafted record fields, ordering of deltas, and retry timing around upgrades
- Exploit idea: double-apply or skip a rewards/configuration transition due to malformed registry-derived state
- Invariant to test: registry mutations must preserve subnet membership, routing, key, version, and upgrade safety invariants
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: consensus configuration compromise, unauthorized node/governance effect, or significant infrastructure integrity loss
- Fast validation: construct registry mutation/orchestrator-consumer tests and assert invariant validation rejects malformed records
