# Q3468: Get Client Connection Paths ibc invariant edge ce4d

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `GetClientConnectionPaths` in `sei-ibc-go/modules/core/03-connection/keeper/keeper.go` via IBC packet, acknowledgement, timeout, or proof relay submitted through public message handlers, controlling packet data, source/destination channel fields, timeout height/timestamp, acknowledgements, proofs, memo fields, and relayer timing, and use memo, denom trace, or address conversion edge cases to redirect, freeze, or mis-account transferred value so that the invariant `escrowed funds, voucher supply, denom traces, acknowledgements, and timeout state must remain conserved across all packet flows` fails, causing `Critical: Permanent freezing of user funds of USD $5,000 or more`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-ibc-go/modules/core/03-connection/keeper/keeper.go:124` `GetClientConnectionPaths`
- Entrypoint: IBC packet, acknowledgement, timeout, or proof relay submitted through public message handlers
- Attacker controls: packet data, source/destination channel fields, timeout height/timestamp, acknowledgements, proofs, memo fields, and relayer timing
- Exploit idea: use memo, denom trace, or address conversion edge cases to redirect, freeze, or mis-account transferred value
- Invariant to test: escrowed funds, voucher supply, denom traces, acknowledgements, and timeout state must remain conserved across all packet flows
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: Permanent freezing of user funds of USD $5,000 or more
- Fast validation: Use IBC keeper/channel tests to relay packet, ack, timeout, and replay variants, then assert escrow, voucher supply, commitments, and acknowledgements remain conserved.
