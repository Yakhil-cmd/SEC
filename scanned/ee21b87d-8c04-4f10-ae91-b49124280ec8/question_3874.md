# Q3874: consensus: maliciously corrupt idkg dealings resource accounting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through an unprivileged ingress sender fills payload candidates that reach consensus validation and drive `rs/consensus/idkg/src/malicious_pre_signer.rs`::maliciously_corrupt_idkg_dealings with attacker-controlled artifact bytes, heights, registry versions, validation context, and timing/order of gossip to make fees, cycles, memory, instructions, or refunds diverge across success, reject, trap, and retry paths; specifically, can this race purge/admission logic so a stale but well-formed artifact influences finalization, violating the invariant that below-threshold peers must not break consensus safety, liveness, or finalized chain uniqueness, and produce HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/consensus/idkg/src/malicious_pre_signer.rs`::maliciously_corrupt_idkg_dealings
- Entrypoint: an unprivileged ingress sender fills payload candidates that reach consensus validation
- Attacker controls: artifact bytes, heights, registry versions, validation context, and timing/order of gossip
- Exploit idea: race purge/admission logic so a stale but well-formed artifact influences finalization
- Invariant to test: below-threshold peers must not break consensus safety, liveness, or finalized chain uniqueness
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical: consensus integrity compromise or arbitrary invalid block insertion/finalization
- Fast validation: construct a local consensus/pool test with two artifact arrival orders and assert identical validation/finalization results
