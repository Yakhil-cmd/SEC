# Q3702: state certification: verify certificate signature replay/idempotency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through publicly reachable verification path and drive `rs/certification/src/lib.rs`::verify_certificate_signature with attacker-controlled chunk contents, manifest hashes, labeled-tree paths, certification versions, and witness requests to replay, repeat, or race an accepted message so the side effect is applied twice or cleanup is skipped; specifically, can this make two different states share an accepted manifest/hash-tree witness under edge-case labels, violating the invariant that state sync must only install authenticated chunks matching the certified manifest, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: forged certified state, invalid state installation, or replicated-state integrity loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/certification/src/lib.rs`::verify_certificate_signature
- Entrypoint: publicly reachable verification path
- Attacker controls: chunk contents, manifest hashes, labeled-tree paths, certification versions, and witness requests
- Exploit idea: make two different states share an accepted manifest/hash-tree witness under edge-case labels
- Invariant to test: state sync must only install authenticated chunks matching the certified manifest
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: forged certified state, invalid state installation, or replicated-state integrity loss
- Fast validation: build a manifest/witness differential test with malformed chunks or labels and assert hash/certification rejection; repeat the same request before and after callback/timer boundaries and assert exactly-once effects
