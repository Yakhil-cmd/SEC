# Q2168: chain fusion: make idle bounds/overflow

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through a protocol peer or adapter client supplies chain-fusion payloads that enter consensus or minter state and drive `rs/bitcoin/adapter/src/blockchainmanager.rs`::make_idle with attacker-controlled memos, reimbursement IDs, transaction status, fee estimates, finality depth, adapter responses, and ledger callbacks to hit boundary values for lengths, amounts, timestamps, heights, and indexes to cause aliasing or overflow; specifically, can this accept an external-chain log/UTXO/transaction under the wrong finality, address, token, or chain context, violating the invariant that threshold signing must only authorize transactions derived from valid minter state, and produce HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rs/bitcoin/adapter/src/blockchainmanager.rs`::make_idle
- Entrypoint: a protocol peer or adapter client supplies chain-fusion payloads that enter consensus or minter state
- Attacker controls: memos, reimbursement IDs, transaction status, fee estimates, finality depth, adapter responses, and ledger callbacks
- Exploit idea: accept an external-chain log/UTXO/transaction under the wrong finality, address, token, or chain context
- Invariant to test: threshold signing must only authorize transactions derived from valid minter state
- Expected HackenProof impact: HackenProof Critical/High: chain-fusion asset theft, illegal ck-token minting, or permanent withdrawal/deposit loss
- Fast validation: simulate external-chain events and ledger callbacks in state-machine tests, then assert supply conservation and idempotency; include min/max amounts, zero values, max heights, oversized payloads, and duplicate IDs
