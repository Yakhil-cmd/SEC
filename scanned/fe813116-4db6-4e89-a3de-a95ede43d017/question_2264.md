# Q2264: Set Store Loader app tx invariant edge 79b8

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `SetStoreLoader` in `sei-cosmos/baseapp/options.go` via public Cosmos/EVM transaction processed by BaseApp and ante handlers, controlling transaction bytes, signatures, fee fields, message ordering, extension options, gas limits, and account sequence values, and trigger panic or unbounded work in default transaction processing using only public message fields so that the invariant `transaction bytes, signatures, fees, gas, message validation, and execution must be interpreted consistently across CheckTx and DeliverTx` fails, causing `Critical: Direct loss of user funds of USD $5,000 or more, excluding gas fees and yield`?

## Target
- File/function: `sei-cosmos/baseapp/options.go:239` `SetStoreLoader`
- Entrypoint: public Cosmos/EVM transaction processed by BaseApp and ante handlers
- Attacker controls: transaction bytes, signatures, fee fields, message ordering, extension options, gas limits, and account sequence values
- Exploit idea: trigger panic or unbounded work in default transaction processing using only public message fields
- Invariant to test: transaction bytes, signatures, fees, gas, message validation, and execution must be interpreted consistently across CheckTx and DeliverTx
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: Direct loss of user funds of USD $5,000 or more, excluding gas fees and yield
- Fast validation: Encode the transaction through the app TxConfig, execute CheckTx and FinalizeBlock/DeliverTx, and assert fees, gas, sequence, and state changes match the same interpretation.
